# Isomers

**Isomers** have the same chemical constituents, but a different
structure.

Structural isomers: different bond structure (see **tautomerism** )

Stereoisomers: same bond structure, different 3-d structure.

\- Geometric isomers - free rotation is restricted by C=C or ring
structure, giving *cis/trans* forms.

\- Optical isomers (Enantiomers) - mirror images around a chiral centre.
Designated *laevo/ dextro* according to the direction of rotation of
polarised light, or more recently R (rectus) or S (sinister). Eg.
Bupivacaine, Ketamine.
