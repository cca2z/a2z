# Filters

**Filters** Four important principles are used by anaesthetic *dry gas*
filters to remove particles (S-I-D-E):

1. *<span class="underline">S</span> ieve* effect - pores prevent
passage of particles bigger than the maximum pore diameter. However, dry
gas filters rely on the other three mechanisms and have a wide range of
pore sizes in the mesh.

2. *<span class="underline">I</span> nertial collection* - channels
through filter are convoluted, and particles are heavier than gas so
they accumulate on corners in the channels.

3. *<span class="underline">D</span> iffusional impaction* - small
(&lt;0.5μm) particles are caught on the sides of pores as they bounce
around due to Brownian motion.

4. *<span class="underline">E</span> lectrostatic* - charge differences
between particles and filter membranes cause attraction.

Hygroscopic (absorbs water from atmosphere) element is added to provide
heat and moisture exchange (see **Humidification** ).

Breathing system filters are of two types:

1. Hydrophobic: pleated hydrophobic fibres prevent water from carrying
particles through filter. Very small pores.

2. Electrostatic: extra charge is applied to fibres to enhance
electrostatic effect. Large pores.

Breathing system filters should filter out particles &gt;2 μm diameter
