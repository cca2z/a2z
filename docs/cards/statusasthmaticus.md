ICU - ventilation, volatiles. Unfortunately low density gases such as
helium do not work because the obstruction is in the small airways where
flow is laminar.

Initial ventilator settings:

I:E 1:4

MV &lt;115 ml/kg

V <sub>T</sub> &lt;8 ml/kg

RR 10-14/min

Inspiratory flow 80 to 100 l/min (low Ti:Te ratio)

The main problem is hyperinflation. Complications (hypotension and
barotrauma) are predicted by end-inspiratory volume (Vei) above
functional respiratory capacity (&gt;20ml/kg is high risk). This can be
measured by collecting total exhaled volume in a paralysed patient over
60 seconds of apnoea.

Vei can be estimated by scaling up the VT to account for the effect of
intrinsic PEEP:

Vei = VT x Pplat/(Plat-PEEPi)
