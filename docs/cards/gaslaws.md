# Gas Laws

**Gas Laws** Regarding a fixed mass of gas:

Boyle's Law: for constant temperature P varies as 1/V

Charles' Law: for constant pressure, V varies as T

Third gas Law: for constant volume, P varies as T

If you remember what is constant, the rest is intuitive. Boyle:
temperature; Charles (the balloonist): pressure.
