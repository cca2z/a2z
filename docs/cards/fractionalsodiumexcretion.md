# Fractional sodium excretion (FENa). (

**Fractional sodium excretion (FENa). (** See **renal failure - acute.**
) The percentage of the sodium in the glomerular filtrate that is
excreted. Since 100% (near enough) of filtered creatinine is excreted,
FENa is calculated by 'scaling up' the urine:plasma sodium ratio by
multiplying it by the inverse of the urine:plasma creatinine ratio.

Normal PCr = 60Î¼mol/l; normal UCr = 10mmol/l.

FENa &lt; 1% in pre-renal failure as normal compensation ( **RAAS** )
reclaims sodium from filtrate.

FENa &gt; 2% in acute tubular necrosis.
