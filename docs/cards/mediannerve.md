# Median nerve

**Median nerve** forms anterior to the distal third of the axillary
artery from the lateral and medial cords of the **brachial plexus.** It
travels lateral to the brachial artery until halfway down the humerus,
when it crosses over in front of the artery (1 in 7 pass behind) and
then passes medial to the brachial artery into the **antecubital fossa**
. It adheres to the deep side of flexor digitorum superficialis through
the forearm but emerges to close to the wrist before passing under the
flexor retinaculum. At this point it lies between palmaris longus and
flexor carpi radialis.
