# Jehovah's Witnesses

**Jehovah's Witnesses** often (but not always) refuse to receive
allogeneic blood products. Their perioperative management is guided by
three principles:

1. Careful discussion of the precise limits the patient wishes to place
upon treatment. (some patients will accept pre-donation of red cells,
cell salvage, and cardiopulmonary bypass).

2. Preservation of red blood cells

a. Start high: use EPO

b. Dilute losses: haemodilution

c. Prevent bleeding: regional anaesthetic, elevate site, use
desmopressin ( \\uparrow factor VIII) and tranexamic acid
(anti-fibrinolytic)

3. Survival of profound anaemia: hypothermia, neuromuscular blockade,
100% oxygen, hyperbaric oxygen.
