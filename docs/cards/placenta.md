# Placenta

**Placenta** . Drugs pass a lipid bilayer to cross the placenta.

<span class="underline">Lipid solubility</span> : Hydrophilic drugs
transfer slowly through sparse aqueous channels. Rate is according to
**Fick's law of diffusion** . Lipophilic drugs cross freely, so delivery
to the foetus is essentially determined by placental blood flow.

<span class="underline">Protein binding</span> : highly protein-bound
drugs in plasma have a relatively low 'free' concentration to diffuse
across the placenta

<span class="underline">Ionisation</span> : highly ionised molecules do
not cross. 'Ion trapping' occurs when a molecule becomes ionised on the
more acidic foetal side of the placenta.
