# Circle system

**Circle system** May be *semi-open* or *closed* . It is closed when
fresh gas flow rate (FGF) = uptake of gases by patient. In steady state,
this means FGF = VO<sub>2</sub> .

The standard arrangement of components is shown in the figure.
Re-breathing will not occur as long as there are two unidirectional
valves between the four components (A-B-C-F) and the patient.

Time constant for equilibration = Volume of circle/fresh gas flow.
