# Guillain-Barr√© syndrome

causes ascending weakness and sensory impairment and acute autonomic
neuropathy with labile BP, arrhythmias and urinary retention. It follows
a precipitant such as viral illness, campylobacter *jejunii* infection
or vaccination. Anti-neuronal antibodies are present; lymphocytic
infiltration of nerves causes demyelination. **CSF** protein is raised.

In addition to supportive management, immunoglobulin therapy or
plasmapheresis are effective. In a self-ventilating patient, as with all
neuromuscular disorders, the key measurement of respiratory muscle
weakness is *vital capacity* (see **Pulmonary function tests** ).
