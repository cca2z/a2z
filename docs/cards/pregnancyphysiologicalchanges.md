# Pregnancy, physiological changes

**Pregnancy, physiological changes** Purpose: supply metabolic demands
of foetus, prepare for delivery.

Airway (the five Ts):

*<span class="underline">T</span>* ongue - increase in size

*<span class="underline">T</span>* ight larynx due to physiological
oedema/ pre-eclampsia

*<span class="underline">T</span>* ime - ↓ FRC and ↑metabolism cause
rapid desaturation

*<span class="underline">T</span>* oo much swelling of nasal mucosa to
pass N-P airway

*<span class="underline">B</span>* reasts get in the way of laryngoscope
handle. (Alleviated by head-up tilt, polio handle.)

Respiratory:

\- ↑V <sub>T</sub> by 50% ∴ ↑alveolar ventilation, P <sub>a</sub>
CO<sub>2</sub> falls by 1kPa, P <sub>a</sub> O<sub>2</sub> increases by
1kPa. Improves gradient for placental CO<sub>2</sub> clearance.

\- Diaphragmatic splinting

\- ↓ FRC by 20%. Supine at term, FRC ↓ by 50%.

Cardiovascular:

\- Na <sup>+</sup> and H2O retention ∴ ↑circulating volume (peak at
32weeks), ↑ **cardiac output** . **Blood volume** at term = 100mls/kg

\- ↓ **SVR** ∴ ↓ MAP

\- 10% increase in heart rate.

\- Venous return diverted through epidural veins.

Neurological:

\- Emotional lability.

\- Anterior pituitary increases in size threefold.

Haematological:

\- Increase in red cell mass but overall haemodilution.

\- Hypercoagulable state: increases in clotting factors (II, XII, X),
decreased protein S, decreased responsiveness to protein C (see
**coagulation** ).

Renal

\- ↑RPF by 40%, ∴ ↑GFR.

\- Urinary stasis.

Gastrointestinal

\- decreased tone in lower oesophageal sphincter, pressure on stomach,
reflux.

Metabolic

\- VO<sub>2</sub> increases by 20%.

\- 30% fall in plasma cholinesterase (see **esterases** )

\- Circulating triglycerides increase threefold

\- cholesterol increases 50%.

\- Reset osmostat down to 270mOsm/l

Locomotor

\- global increase in ligament laxity.
