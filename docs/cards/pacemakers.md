# Pacemakers

**Pacemakers** Nomenclature: 3 or 5 letters, eg. DDDOO.

\[Bernstein, AD, Pacing Clin Electrophysiol 2002; 25:260.\]

'Magnet response': most pacemakers alter their function in response to
application of a magnet above the pacemaker box. Most often, this simply
reverts the pacemaker to a demand mode at a rate of 60/min. However,
there is a variety of responses, some of which may involve the complete
cessation of cardiac output, which can lead to end-organ damage. Not
advisable.
