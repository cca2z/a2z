# Diffusion

**Diffusion** For any freely moving substance, Fick's law applies

*Net rate of transfer = -A\*D\*dc/dx*

A = area of plane

D = diffusion coefficient

dC/dx = concentration gradient - the change in concentration (ΔC: C1-C2)
over a given distance (Δx).

Across a lipid membrane, this becomes:

*Net rate of transfer = β\*A\*D\*dC/dx*

β = oil:gas partition coefficient

Diffusion coefficient is calculated by the Stokes-Einstein equation:

D = bT/6\*π\*viscosity\*molecular radius

T=temp

b= Boltzmann's constant: the **gas constant** divided by **Avogadro's
constant.**

The examiners will be expecting molecular weight to appear in there
somewhere. Molecular weight is approximately proportional to r
<sup>3</sup> for large molecules, and for molecules less than 300Da, MW
is proportional to r <sup>2</sup> , so diffusion is proportional to
1/√MW ( **Graham's law** ).
