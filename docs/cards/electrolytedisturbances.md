# Electrolyte disturbances

**Electrolyte disturbances**

*Hyperkalaemia.* ECG changes (poorly correlated with \[K <sup>+</sup>
\]): First peaked T waves, then slowing conduction, broad QRS, long PR,
RBBB/LBBB, loss of p-waves. Ultimately sine wave

*Hypokalaemia* . ECG changes (poorly correlated with \[K <sup>+</sup>
\]): ST depression, small T-waves, large U-waves

*Hypercalcaemia.* Bones, stones, abdominal groans and psychic moans. ECG
changes: Long P-R interval, heart block. Flattened or inverted T-waves.

*Hypocalcaemia.* Carpopedal spasm, parasthesiae in extremities, positive
Chvostek's sign (tapping over **facial nerve** causes twitching of
facial muscles) and Trousseau's sign (inflating cuff round arm causes
spasm of arm muscles).

ECG changes xxx

*Hypophosphataemia* xxx

*Hypermagnesaemia xxx*

*Hyponatraemia.* Confusion, seizures, coma. Commonest cause is
bendrofluazide. Also SIADH, polydipsia. Correct Na+ slowly, particularly
if hyponatraemia is chronic. 2mmol/l per hour in first 6h, max
10-12mmol/l per day.
