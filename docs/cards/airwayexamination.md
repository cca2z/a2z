# Airway examination

**Airway examination** aims to predict difficult airway management. Five
separate factors are considered:

1. Face mask ventilation (neck flexion, head extension, sunken cheeks,
beard)

2. Laryngeal mask insertion (mouth opening)

3. Direct laryngoscopy (see below)

4. Tracheal intubation (laryngeal oedema, tracheal stenosis)

5. Emergency cricothyroidotomy (obesity / cancer / haematoma / previous
surgery/radiotherapy)

6. Extubation (oedema, tracheomalacia, tracheal stenosis (eg. Down's,
acromegaly, thyroidectomy))

Difficult direct laryngoscopy is predicted by:

Mallampati test

Thyromental distance (Patil test)

Overbite scale - A- easy B- in line C - can't overbite.

Mouth opening - less than two fingers - tricky
