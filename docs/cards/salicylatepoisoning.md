# Salicylate poisoning

**Salicylate poisoning** usually caused by ingestion of aspirin or oil
of wintergreen. Nausea, tinnitus (quite reliably), hyperthermia,
progressing to metabolic acidosis, coma, pulmonary oedema.

Initial ABG shows respiratory alkalosis due to direct respiratory centre
stimulation. Then altered metabolism produces a raised **anion gap**
acidosis - predominantly a lactic acidosis and **ketoacidosis** .

Treatment is alkalinisation of urine to trap ionised salicylic acid (NB
hyperkalaemia must be aggressively corrected to achieve this) and
haemofiltration/dialysis.

Alkalosis preserves ionised salicylic acid in plasma, preventing
contamination of brain. Intubation usually obliterates the existing
respiratory alkalosis, leading to cerebral injury and death.
