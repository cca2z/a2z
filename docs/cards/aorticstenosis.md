# Aortic stenosis

**Aortic stenosis** Hypertrophied left ventricle with very high
intra-ventricular pressures leads to critical **coronary** flow. The
non-compliant ventricle is more dependent on atrial contraction for
filling. A drop in blood pressure precipirates a *catastrophic downward
spiral* of decreasing cardiac output, decreasing coronary blood flow,
subendocardial ischaemia, impaired contractility, further decrease in
cardiac output.
