# Hepatitis B

**Hepatitis B** . DNA virus, relatively easily transmitted through
blood, bodily secretions, sex. Endemic in China (10% carrier rate);
affects 300million people worldwide. Causes acute hepatitis (acute liver
failure in 1%) followed by:

\- Recovery: 90%

\- Chronic infection: 10%

o 20% develop cirrhosis within 20yrs

o Hepatocellular carcinoma

Prognosis is much worse for neonates infected by vertical transmission.
Acute treatment with immunisation and hyperimmune serum globulin, and
chronic treatment with pegylated interferon, lamivudine, and other
antivirals may substantially improve outcome.
