<h1 id="chi-squared-test">Chi-squared test</h1>

<p><strong>Chi-squared test</strong> applies to a 2 x 2 table, eg.:</p>

<p>Examines whether there is an association between the row variable and
the column variable. It compares the <em>observed</em> data with the results
<em>expected if there were no association:</em></p>

<p>(observed-expected) <sup>2</sup> /expected</p>

<p>This is done for each of the four squares in the table, and the results
are all added together:</p>

<p>Χ <sup>2</sup> = ∑ (O-E) <sup>2</sup> /E</p>

<p>The significance value is then read from a table of the Chi distribution
(higher Χ <sup>2</sup> = lower p-value). If there are less than 20
subjects then <em>Fisher’s exact test</em> is used.</p>
