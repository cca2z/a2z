<p><strong>Gas Laws</strong> Regarding a fixed mass of gas:</p>

<p>Boyle’s Law: for constant temperature P varies as 1/V</p>

<p>Charles’ Law: for constant pressure, V varies as T</p>

<p>Third gas Law: for constant volume, P varies as T</p>

<p>If you remember what is constant, the rest is intuitive. Boyle:
temperature; Charles (the balloonist): pressure.</p>
