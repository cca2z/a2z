<h1 id="phrenic-nerve">Phrenic nerve</h1>

<p><strong>Phrenic nerve</strong> arises from C3,4,5 (keeps the diaphragm alive) and
passes down over scalenus anterior (see <strong>C6 slice</strong> ) before passing in
front of the subclavian artery and behind the subclavian vein to enter
the thorax. It descends in the mediastinum, just medial to the pleura.
On the right it runs lateral to the great veins. On the left, it passes
just lateral to the left ventricle. The phrenic nerve is the only
innervation of the <strong>diaphragm</strong> .</p>
