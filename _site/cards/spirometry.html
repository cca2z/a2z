<h1 id="spirometry">Spirometry</h1>

<p><strong>Spirometry</strong> can measure FEV <sub>1</sub> , FVC, flow: volume loops,
and reversibility to bronchodilators (a 12% rise in FEV <sub>1</sub>
indicates bronchodilator-responsiveness).</p>

<p>FEV1 is reduced in obstructive disease, FVC is reduced in restrictive
and obstructive disease.</p>

<p>Flow:volume loops can detect obstruction of the upper airway. A fixed
obstruction (eg. a calcified lesion in the trachea) limits flow in both
directions, causing a plateau in both inspiration and expiration. If
there is a dynamic extrathoracic obstruction, the narrowing gets smaller
during inspiration, when the pressure outside the trachea is greater
than the pressure inside the trachea. In contrast, a dynamic
intrathoracic narrowing gets bigger during inspiration because it is
pulled apart as the lungs expand, and the pressure in the trachea is
greater than the pressure in the thorax.</p>
