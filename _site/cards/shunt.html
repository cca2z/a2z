<h1 id="shunt">Shunt</h1>

<p><strong>Shunt</strong> Abnormal passage of blood from one side of the circulation to
the other. Normally taken to mean right-to-left shunt: venous blood
passes from right side of heart to left side without encountering
alveolar gas. (See <strong>V/Q mismatch</strong> : shunt is Q without V.)
Physiological shunt occurs through bronchial circulation and Thebesian
veins.</p>
