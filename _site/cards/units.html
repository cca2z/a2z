<h1 id="units">Units</h1>

<p><strong>Units</strong> In the SI system, there are 7 base units:</p>

<p>Potential difference = power/current = current*resistance
(Haemodynamics: Pressure difference = flow*resistance).</p>

<p>Work = force*distance (Physiology: work = pressure*volume</p>

<p>Charge is number of electrons xxx. 1 coulomb is quantity of charge
passing a single point when 1A flows for 1s. (=6x10 <sup>18</sup>
electrons).</p>

<p>Capacitance = charge/voltage. 1 farad is one coulomb stored per volt
applied.(Haemodynamics: Capacitance = volume stored/pressure.)</p>

<p>Energy stored in a capacitor = Â½CV <sub>2</sub></p>

<p>Force = mass * acceleration. 1 Newton is the force required to
accelerate a mass of 1kg at 1m/s <sup>2</sup> .</p>

<p>Energy= work = force x distance. 1J = 1Nm. 1 Joule is the energy
expended when an object subjected to a force of 1N moves 1m in the
direction of the force. (Work=F*d).</p>

<p>Power = energy/time. 1W=1J/s.</p>
