<h1 id="inhalational-anaesthetic-agents">Inhalational anaesthetic agents</h1>

<p><strong>Inhalational anaesthetic agents</strong> are more potent if they have a
larger oil:gas solubility coefficient (the <strong>Meyer-Overton observation</strong>
) and have faster <strong>uptake</strong> and offset times if they are insoluble in
blood.</p>

<p>All are <strong>ethers</strong> , apart from halothane which is a <em><span class="underline">halo</span></em>genated e<em><span class="underline">thane</span></em>.</p>

<p>Desflurane, enflurane and to a lesser extent isoflurane produce carbon
monoxide in reaction with dry soda lime.</p>
