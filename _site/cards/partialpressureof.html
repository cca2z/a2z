<p><strong>Partial pressure of a gas dissolved in a liquid</strong> is a perplexing
concept: it is defined as being equal to the partial pressure of that
gas in a mixture of gases in equilibrium with the liquid. Normally there
is a linear relationship between partial pressure the and dissolved gas
content ( <strong>Henryâ€™s law</strong> ) but this is not the case with oxygen (see
<strong>Haemoglobin</strong> ) or <strong>carbon dioxide</strong> dissolving in blood.</p>
