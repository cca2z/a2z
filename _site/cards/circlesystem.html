<h1 id="circle-system">Circle system</h1>

<p><strong>Circle system</strong> May be <em>semi-open</em> or <em>closed</em> . It is closed when
fresh gas flow rate (FGF) = uptake of gases by patient. In steady state,
this means FGF = VO<sub>2</sub> .</p>

<p>The standard arrangement of components is shown in the figure.
Re-breathing will not occur as long as there are two unidirectional
valves between the four components (A-B-C-F) and the patient.</p>

<p>Time constant for equilibration = Volume of circle/fresh gas flow.</p>
