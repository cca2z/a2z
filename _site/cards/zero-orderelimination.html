<h1 id="zero-order-elimination">Zero-order elimination</h1>

<p><strong>Zero-order elimination</strong> (dC/dt = k) is unusual (see
<strong>pharmacokinetics</strong> ). Fall in concentration over time is linear. It
tends to occur when a metabolic system is saturated, and leads to
accumulation of drug. Eg. Heparin, Aspirin, Phenytoin, and Ethanol.</p>
