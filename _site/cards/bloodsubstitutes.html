<h1 id="blood-substitutes">Blood substitutes</h1>

<p><strong>Blood substitutes</strong> have not yet made it to clinical practice. They
are of two types: perfluorocarbons (hydrocarbons with fluorine replacing
the hydrogens) and haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers. Both transport
oxygen, have short (12h) half-lives, and impair microvascular perfusion.</p>

<p>Perfluorocarbons are highly insoluble, so they are presented as a lipid
emulsion in egg phosphatide, just like propofol. Oxygen does not bind to
PFCs but they have an essentially unlimited capacity to dissolve gases,
so there is a linear relationship between oxygen content and PO2.</p>
