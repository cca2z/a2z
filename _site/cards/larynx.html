<h1 id="larynx">Larynx</h1>

<p><strong>Larynx</strong> consists of the hyaline thyroid, cricoid and arytenoid
cartilages. Mucosa is innervated from above by the internal branch of
the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) and from below by the recurrent
laryngeal nerve (RLN). Both are branches of vagus. Traditionally,
intrinsic muscles are innervated by RLN, apart from cricothyroid which
is innervated by external branch of SLN.</p>

<p>The intrinsic muscles are:</p>

<p>Regulate tension in vocal chords: vocalis, cricothyroid, thyroarytenoid</p>

<p>Close glottis: interarytenoid; lateral cricoarytenoid.</p>

<p>RLN palsy: if <em>partial</em> , the chord lies in the midline (Semonâ€™s law
xxx). If <em>complete,</em> the chord lies half-adducted (the cadaveric
position).</p>
