<h1 id="alloimmunisation">Alloimmunisation</h1>

<p><strong>Alloimmunisation</strong> is common in patients who have received multiple
<strong>blood transfusions</strong> . Circulating antibodies to Rhesus, Kell, Lewis,
Duffy and Kidd antigens make cross-matching difficult. Blood products
(even platelets) given to Rhesus negative women of child-bearing age
should always be Rhesus-negative.</p>
