<p><strong>Tricyclic antidepressants</strong> (see <strong>antidepressants</strong> ). Toxicity is
primarily mediated through Type 1a <strong>antiarrythmic</strong> action.
<strong>Anticholinergic</strong> signs are present, and sedation results from
antihistamine action. Sudden deterioration is common.</p>

<p>QRS duration QRS &gt;100ms predicts arrhythmia. Also S <sub>1</sub>
pattern, R wave in AVR.</p>

<p>Management centres on aggressive cardiovascular resuscitation with
fluid, NaHCO <sub>3</sub> , and noradrenaline to maintain MAP.</p>

<p>NaHCO <sub>3</sub> narrows the QRS complex and improves blood pressure.
The probable mechanism is an increase in the neutral form of the TCA,
which reduces binding to Na <sup>+</sup> channels.</p>
