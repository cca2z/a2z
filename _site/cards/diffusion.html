<h1 id="diffusion">Diffusion</h1>

<p><strong>Diffusion</strong> For any freely moving substance, Fick’s law applies</p>

<p><em>Net rate of transfer = -A*D*dc/dx</em></p>

<p>A = area of plane</p>

<p>D = diffusion coefficient</p>

<p>dC/dx = concentration gradient - the change in concentration (ΔC: C1-C2)
over a given distance (Δx).</p>

<p>Across a lipid membrane, this becomes:</p>

<p><em>Net rate of transfer = β*A*D*dC/dx</em></p>

<p>β = oil:gas partition coefficient</p>

<p>Diffusion coefficient is calculated by the Stokes-Einstein equation:</p>

<p>D = bT/6*π*viscosity*molecular radius</p>

<p>T=temp</p>

<p>b= Boltzmann’s constant: the <strong>gas constant</strong> divided by <strong>Avogadro’s
constant.</strong></p>

<p>The examiners will be expecting molecular weight to appear in there
somewhere. Molecular weight is approximately proportional to r
<sup>3</sup> for large molecules, and for molecules less than 300Da, MW
is proportional to r <sup>2</sup> , so diffusion is proportional to
1/√MW ( <strong>Graham’s law</strong> ).</p>
