<h1 id="probabilities">Probabilities</h1>

<p><strong>Probabilities</strong> can be combined using:</p>

<p><em><span class="underline">Additive Rule</span></em> :</p>

<p>Probability of A <em>or</em> B = probability of A + probability of B</p>

<p><em><span class="underline">Multiplicative Rule</span></em> :</p>

<p>Probability of A <em>and</em> B = probability of A x probability of B</p>
