<h1 id="baroreceptors">Baroreceptors</h1>

<p><strong>Baroreceptors</strong> (see <strong>Valsalva manoeuvre</strong> ) Arterial baroreceptors
are phasic (as opposed to tonic) receptors so they respond profoundly to
<em>change</em> in pressure, and only weakly to <em>absolute</em> pressure. This means
that the strength of the pulsation is sensed more accurately than the
pressure, suggesting that evolution is more interested in cardiac output
than blood pressure. xxx</p>

<p>Afferent signals from aortic arch baroreceptors travel in the vagus, and
from carotid body baroreceptors in the glossopharangeal nerve. Signals
are integrated in the vasomotor centre in the medulla.</p>
