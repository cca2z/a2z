<p><strong>Cervical spine injury</strong> Clearing the C-spine in an unconscious patient
is difficult. C-spine CT with 3D reconstruction is generally considered
adequate.</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<p>A - Denervation hyperkalaemia following suxamethonium does not usually
onset until 48h after injury.</p>

<p>Resp - C3,4,5 innervate <strong>diaphragm</strong> . Accessory muscles innervated by
cervical and thoracic nerves. These may contribute 60% of tidal volume
in some patients.</p>

<p>CVS - neurogenic shock secondary to sympathetic denervation.</p>

<p>Other: ileus is common; DVT prophylaxis mandatory.</p>
