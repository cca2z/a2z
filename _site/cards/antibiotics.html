<p><strong>Antibiotics</strong></p>

<p>Pharmacodynamics vary considerably: bacterial eradication is
time-dependent for Î²-lactams (ie dependent on the time spent above <em>MIC</em>
), concentration-dependent for aminoglycosides (ie more killing at
higher peak concentrations) and total drug exposure-dependent for
vancomycin, fluoroquinolones (ie dependent on the <em>AUC</em> above <em>MIC</em> ).</p>
