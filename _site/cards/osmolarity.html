<h1 id="osmolarity">Osmolarity</h1>

<p><strong>Osmolarity</strong> is number of osmoles in a litre of specific solvent</p>

<p><em>Osmolality</em> is number of osmoles xxx in a kilogram of xxx.</p>

<p><em>Osmotic pressure</em> is the hydrostatic pressure required to oppose
movement of water across a semipermeable membrane to or from a given
solution. This assumes an ideal membrane permeable only to water.</p>

<p><em>Tonicity</em> is effective osmolality at a real cell membrane. Some
molecules, such as glucose, move across the cell membrane, so they are
<em>ineffective</em> <em>osmoles</em> and hence contribute little to tonicity.</p>

<p>Van’t Hoff’s law osmotic pressure π = ΘciRT.</p>

<p>Osmolarity = Θci</p>

<p>Mystery is Θ. This corrects for the difference in behaviour of real
solutions from ideal. Eg. NaCl Θ = 0.93. So for a 154mM solution of
NaCl, osmolality is 286, not 308 as predicted.</p>

<p>Colligative properties are dependent on concentration rather than
chemical properties. They are: osmotic pressure, freezing point
depression, vapour pressure depression, increase in boiling point.</p>

<p>In °C, ΔTf = 1.86 Θci</p>

<p>From NPSA report on hypotonic saline in kids: [xxx note that osmolarity
is wrong since Θ is not taken into account]</p>
