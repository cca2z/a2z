<h1 id="salicylate-poisoning">Salicylate poisoning</h1>

<p><strong>Salicylate poisoning</strong> usually caused by ingestion of aspirin or oil
of wintergreen. Nausea, tinnitus (quite reliably), hyperthermia,
progressing to metabolic acidosis, coma, pulmonary oedema.</p>

<p>Initial ABG shows respiratory alkalosis due to direct respiratory centre
stimulation. Then altered metabolism produces a raised <strong>anion gap</strong>
acidosis - predominantly a lactic acidosis and <strong>ketoacidosis</strong> .</p>

<p>Treatment is alkalinisation of urine to trap ionised salicylic acid (NB
hyperkalaemia must be aggressively corrected to achieve this) and
haemofiltration/dialysis.</p>

<p>Alkalosis preserves ionised salicylic acid in plasma, preventing
contamination of brain. Intubation usually obliterates the existing
respiratory alkalosis, leading to cerebral injury and death.</p>
