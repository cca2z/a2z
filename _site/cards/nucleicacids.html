<h1 id="nucleic-acids">Nucleic acids</h1>

<p><strong>Nucleic acids</strong> are made up of bases (eg. adenine) bound to ribose or
deoxyribose to make a nucleoside (eg. adenosine) and phosphorylated at
the 5’ or 3’ position to make a nucleotide. Bases can be purines
(adenine, guanine) or pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, uracil).</p>

<p>Pyrimidines: Thymine production requires <strong>folate</strong> , and is prevented
by inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (eg. Methotrexate) or
methionine synthetase (eg. <strong>Nitrous oxide</strong> ).</p>
