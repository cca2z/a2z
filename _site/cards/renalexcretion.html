<h1 id="renal-excretion">Renal excretion</h1>

<p><strong>Renal excretion</strong> (See hepatic excretion).</p>

<p><em>Filtration</em> - molecules &lt; 30kDa or highly positively charged
molecules are excreted unchanged in urine.</p>

<p><em>Secretion in proximal tubules</em> - a limited capacity exists for
secretion of <strong>acidic and basic drugs</strong> . Thus at maximum excretion
rates, acidic drugs compete with each other, but not with basic drugs,
for secretion.</p>

<p><em>Diffusion in distal tubules</em> - drugs may diffuse down a concentration
gradient in the distal tubules. Drugs diffuse across lipid membranes in
the unionised state, but are then trapped if they become ionised. Hence
acidic drugs get trapped in alkaline urine, because they dissociate in
alkaline conditions. This is used therapeutically in forced alkaline
diuresis in salicylate overdose.</p>
