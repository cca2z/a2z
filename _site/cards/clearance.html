<h1 id="clearance">Clearance</h1>

<p><strong>Clearance</strong> is the volume of <em>plasma</em> cleared of a substance in a
given period of time.</p>

<p>By the definition of <strong>concentration</strong> , <em>for a given time period</em> :</p>

<p>Volume cleared = mass of drug removed / plasma concentration.</p>

<p>The name of the game is working out the mass of drug removed. For renal
clearance, this is the concentration in urine(U) x the volume of urine
produced (V).</p>

<p>Clearance = UV/P</p>

<p>For an infusion at steady state, mass of drug removed = mass of drug
infused so:</p>

<p>Clearance = mass infused/C <sub>P</sub> ss</p>

<p>For any drug,</p>

<p>Clearance = Dose/AUC = V <sub>D</sub> /Ï„ = mass infused/C <sub>P</sub>
ss = UV/P</p>

<p>(See <strong>pharmacokinetics</strong> , <strong>area under curve</strong> ).</p>
