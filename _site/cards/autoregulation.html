<h1 id="autoregulation">Autoregulation</h1>

<p><strong>Autoregulation</strong> of blood flow to an organ is accomplished in three
ways.</p>

<p><em>Metabolic:</em> release of H+, K+, adenosine and CO2 causes vasodilation,
shear stress transduction by endothelium.</p>

<p><em>Myogenic:</em> <strong>Laplace</strong> muscle stretch</p>

<p><em>Neurogenic:</em> autonomic n.s., mainly sympathetic.</p>

<p>Cessation of cerebral electrical activity occurs at a CBF of about
15mls/100g/min.</p>

<p>Propofol improves autoregulation to brain; volatile agents impair it.</p>
