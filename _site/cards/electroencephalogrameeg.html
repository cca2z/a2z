<p><strong>Electroencephalogram (EEG)</strong> . Composite recording of surface
electrical activity from brain. Waveforms divided into four frequency
ranges labelled with Greek letters, but not in alphabetical order. δ
0-4Hz, θ 4-8Hz, α 8-12Hz, β &gt;12Hz. In general, frequency slows with
anaesthesia. Deep anaesthesia causes a burst-suppression pattern, in
which high-amplitude bursts occur separated by longer low-amplitude
‘suppressions’.</p>
