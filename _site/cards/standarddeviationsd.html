<h1 id="standard-deviation-sd">Standard deviation (SD)</h1>

<p><strong>Standard deviation (SD)</strong> is a measure of the <em>spread</em> of values in a
data set. If data conform to the <strong>normal distribution</strong> , then 70% of
the values lie within 1 SD of the mean, and 95% of the values are within
2 SD of the mean. The standard deviation expressed as a percentage of
the mean, is called the <em>coefficient of variation</em> .</p>
