<h1 id="fade">Fade</h1>

<p><strong>Fade</strong> decrease in amplitude of muscle twitches on train-of-four (TOF)
or double-burst stimulation (DBS) testing that occurs with partial
non-depolarising neuromuscular blockade, or phase II block with a
<strong>depolarising muscle relaxant</strong> .</p>

<p>Normally, 50 fewer ACh vesicles are released with each depolarisation
(at 2Hz), but because 5x more ACh is released than is needed for
contraction, fade isnâ€™t seen unless there is substantial receptor
occupancy (see <strong>Michaelis-Menten</strong> ):</p>

<p>1 twitch &gt; 95% receptor occupancy</p>

<p>2 twitches &gt; 90%</p>

<p>3 twitches &gt; 80%</p>

<p>4 twitches &lt;70%</p>
