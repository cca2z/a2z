<h1 id="isomers">Isomers</h1>

<p><strong>Isomers</strong> have the same chemical constituents, but a different
structure.</p>

<p>Structural isomers: different bond structure (see <strong>tautomerism</strong> )</p>

<p>Stereoisomers: same bond structure, different 3-d structure.</p>

<p>- Geometric isomers - free rotation is restricted by C=C or ring
structure, giving <em>cis/trans</em> forms.</p>

<p>- Optical isomers (Enantiomers) - mirror images around a chiral centre.
Designated <em>laevo/ dextro</em> according to the direction of rotation of
polarised light, or more recently R (rectus) or S (sinister). Eg.
Bupivacaine, Ketamine.</p>
