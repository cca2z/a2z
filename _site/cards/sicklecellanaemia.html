<h1 id="sickle-cell-anaemia">Sickle cell anaemia</h1>

<p><strong>Sickle cell anaemia</strong> AR. Incidence: &lt;1% of people of African
descent. Abnormal <strong>haemoglobin (Hb)</strong> (Glu to Val substitution at
position 6 in Hb Î² chain). HbS polymerises in hypoxia, causing
substantially decreased red cell deformability. Importantly, erythrocyte
membrane function and interaction with endothelium are altered.
Treatment: folate supplementation, hydroxyurea, transfusion.</p>

<p>HbSS (sickle disease) polymerises at 6.7kPa</p>

<p>HbAS (sickle trait) polymerises at 2-3kPa</p>

<p>Acute crises:</p>

<p>- Acute pain (vaso-occlusive crisis) - may progress to multi-organ
failure with a <strong>SIRS</strong> response.</p>

<p>- Acute sickle chest syndrome - may be precipitated by infarction, fat
embolism, infection, or <em>surgery</em> . Causes chest pain, pulmonary
infiltrate, and fever.</p>

<p>- Acute severe anaemia:</p>

<p>o Splenic sequestration crisis. Vaso-occlusion within spleen leads to
removal of RBCs from circulation and rapidly enlarging splenomegaly. Rx:
transfusion, prevent further episodes with splenectomy. Mortality 15%.</p>

<p>o Aplastic crisis - transient cessation of erythropoesis. Follows
infection, often with parvovirus B19.</p>

<p>Other problems:</p>

<p>- Pulmonary - 2/3 have asthma, 1/3 have sleep apnoea. Interstitial
fibrosis complicates recurrent acute chest events.</p>

<p>- Liver disease - several causes may co-exist: hepatic infarction,
pigment gallstones, iron overload (from multiple transfusions).</p>

<p>- Renal disease - sickling in renal capillaries (vasa recta).
Haematuria, proteinuria, hypertension are common. 1/3 of patients have
renal impairment.</p>

<p>- Sepsis - increased susceptibility to infection (particularly
S.Pneumoniae) xxx ?? encapsulated organisms?</p>

<p>- Pregnancy - low birth weight, pre-eclampsia, acute chest syndrome,
cerebral venous thrombosis, abruption, infection.</p>

<p>- Stroke</p>

<p>- Avascular necrosis of bone - may cause fat embolism.</p>

<p>- Priapism</p>

<p>Anaesthesia: <em>avoid hypoxia, acidosis, hypovolaemia and hypothermia.</em>
High risk of acute chest syndrome and vaso-occlusive crises, but also
non-sickling complications of surgery (infection, organ failure).
Consider exchange transfusion pre-operatively for high risk cases.
Tourniquet use is controversial. xxx</p>
