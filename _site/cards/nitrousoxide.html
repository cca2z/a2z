<h1 id="nitrous-oxide">Nitrous oxide</h1>

<p><strong>Nitrous oxide</strong> is the only drug that has been used continuously
throughout the history of anaesthesia. Intrinsic NMDA antagonism which
may cause neurotoxicity that is attenuated by concurrent use of GABA
agonist.</p>

<p>Problems:</p>

<p>Increases <strong>CMRO<sub>2</sub></strong> , CBF, and ICP.</p>

<p>Increased PONV</p>

<p>Increased pressure in enclosed gas spaces (Absolute pressure increase =
P <sub>A</sub> N <sub>2</sub> O), increased volume in compliant gas
spaces (Relative volume increase = F <sub>I</sub> N <sub>2</sub> 0/(1-F
<sub>I</sub> N <sub>2</sub> O).</p>

<p>Inhibits methionine synthetase, a key enzyme of <strong>folate</strong>
<strong>metabolism</strong> , causing neurologic deficits in B12-deficient patients,
and exacerbating hyperhomocysteinaemia leading to increased risk of
dementia, and <strong>thrombembolism</strong> .</p>

<p>Surgical wound infection.</p>
