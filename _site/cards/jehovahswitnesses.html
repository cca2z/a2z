<p><strong>Jehovah’s Witnesses</strong> often (but not always) refuse to receive
allogeneic blood products. Their perioperative management is guided by
three principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Careful discussion of the precise limits the patient wishes to place
upon treatment. (some patients will accept pre-donation of red cells,
cell salvage, and cardiopulmonary bypass).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Preservation of red blood cells</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>a. Start high: use EPO</p>

<p>b. Dilute losses: haemodilution</p>

<p>c. Prevent bleeding: regional anaesthetic, elevate site, use
desmopressin ( \uparrow factor VIII) and tranexamic acid
(anti-fibrinolytic)</p>

<ol>
  <li>Survival of profound anaemia: hypothermia, neuromuscular blockade,
100% oxygen, hyperbaric oxygen.</li>
</ol>
