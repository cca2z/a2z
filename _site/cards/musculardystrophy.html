<h1 id="muscular-dystrophy">Muscular dystrophy</h1>

<p><strong>Muscular dystrophy</strong> Duchenne: X-linked, severe: onset age 3-4,
wheelchair-bound by age 10, death from respiratory or cardiac failure
often before age 20.</p>

<p>Becker: ‘Benign X-linked’: onset age 5-20, usually wheelchair-bound
after 25 years of disease.</p>

<p>Examination: male child, waddling lordotic gait. Similar, rarer
conditions may affect girls.</p>

<p>Abnormality in both diseases is in the <em>dystrophin gene</em> , which codes
for a muscle cytoskeletal protein important in interaction of
sarcoplasmic reticulum with plasma membrane.</p>

<p>Anaesthetic problems:</p>

<p>- Respiratory failure, kyphoscoliosis</p>

<p>- Rhabdomyolysis precipitated by suxamethonium or prolonged exposure to
<strong>inhalational anaesthetics</strong> (this is not MH, but is similar).</p>

<p>- Cardiomyopathy.</p>

<p>- Delayed gastric emptying.</p>
