<p><strong>Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome</strong> Arrythmias in association with an
accessory conducting pathway (bundle of Kent) between atria and
ventricles. Prone to SVT, AF, or atrial flutter precipitated by
sympathetic activity. AF may cause VF. Pattern is in 0.2% of ECGs, but
syndrome (arrhythmia) only in 0.02% of people.

<p>Type A: accessory on left side (gives tall <strong>R wave in V <sub>1</sub></strong>
), Type B: accessory on right.</p>

<p>Orthodromic (narrow complex): aim to slow A-V node conduction. Vagal
manoeuvres, adenosine, procainamide.</p>

<p>Antidromic (broad complex): must treat as any broad-complex tachycardia
as diagnosis difficult. Procainamide.</p>

<p>AF: <em>avoid</em> drugs that slow A-V node conduction (eg adenosine,
verapamil) because they will increase transmission through accessory
pathway, potentially causing VF. Cardioversion is important. Flecainide
is often used.</p>
