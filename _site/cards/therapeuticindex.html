<h1 id="therapeutic-index">Therapeutic index</h1>

<p><strong>Therapeutic index</strong> is the ratio of the toxic dose to the therapeutic
dose. For consistency, these are taken as the TD <sub>50</sub> - the
dose at which 50% of <em>population</em> get toxicity and <strong>ED <sub>50</sub></strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>the minimum dose to have desired effect in 50% of <em>population</em> .</li>
</ul>

<p>Therapeutic index = TD <sub>50</sub> /ED <sub>50</sub></p>
