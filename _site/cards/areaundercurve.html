<h1 id="area-under-curve-auc">Area under curve (AUC)</h1>

<p><strong>Area under curve (AUC)</strong> of a graph shows x multiplied by y for a
given range. The area under a concentration-time curve can give you
cardiac output, clearance, and volume of distribution.</p>

<p>AUC = C*T = M/V*t = Mt/V</p>

<p>AUC/MASS = t/V</p>

<p>MASS/AUC = V/t = flow.</p>

<p>V<sub>D</sub> = Î¤*dose/AUC</p>
