<p><strong>Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium</strong> is a get-out-of-jail-free card for any
question about a recessive disorder. Population frequency of dominant
allele = p; frequency of recessive allele = q. <strong>Probability</strong> of each
genotype is in brackets:</p>

<p>Therefore, for any population:</p>

<p>p <sup>2</sup> + 2pq + q <sup>2</sup> = 1</p>
