<p><strong>Conscious sedation</strong> is defined by the Academy of Medical Royal
Colleges as depression of the central nervous system such that treatment
may be carried out, but during which verbal contact with the patient is
maintained throughout. The patient remains conscious, retains protective
reflexes, and responds to verbal commands.</p>
