<p>causes ascending weakness and sensory impairment and acute autonomic
neuropathy with labile BP, arrhythmias and urinary retention. It follows
a precipitant such as viral illness, campylobacter <em>jejunii</em> infection
or vaccination. Anti-neuronal antibodies are present; lymphocytic
infiltration of nerves causes demyelination. <strong>CSF</strong> protein is raised.</p>

<p>In addition to supportive management, immunoglobulin therapy or
plasmapheresis are effective. In a self-ventilating patient, as with all
neuromuscular disorders, the key measurement of respiratory muscle
weakness is <em>vital capacity</em> (see <strong>Pulmonary function tests</strong> ).</p>
