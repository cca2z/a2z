<h1 id="coagulation">Coagulation</h1>

<p><strong>Coagulation</strong> <em>in vivo</em> is a complex self-propagating interaction
between cells, clotting factors, endogenous anti-coagulants, platelets,
and fibrinolytic enzymes. It can be initiated by numerous factors
including exposure of tissue factor or collagen, and platelet
activation.</p>

<p>Clot formation has 5 steps:</p>

<p>- <em><span class="underline">Initiation</span></em> (Tissue factor or
collagen. VIIa is critical, IX, and X produce small amounts of thrombin)</p>

<p>- <em><span class="underline">Amplification</span></em> (thrombin activates
platelets and clotting factors, which in turn increase thrombin
production ( <em>positive feedback</em> ))</p>

<p>- <em><span class="underline">Propagation</span></em> (thrombin burst)</p>

<p>- <em><span class="underline">Stabilisation</span></em> (thrombin-activatable
fibrinolysis inhibitor)</p>

<p>- <em><span class="underline">Prevention</span></em> of further coagulation
(activated protein C, antithrombin)</p>
