<h1 id="haemoglobin-hb">Haemoglobin (Hb)</h1>

<p><strong>Haemoglobin (Hb)</strong> (MW 64558Da) has four <strong>haem</strong> molecules, each of
which binds one molecule of oxygen.</p>

<p>Adult Hb (HbA) has 2α and 2β subunits;</p>

<p>foetal Hb (HbF) has 2α and 2γ;</p>

<p>Variant adult Hb (HbA <sub>2</sub> ) has 2α and 2δ.</p>

<p>When O2 binds to a subunit, Hb changes from the T (‘tight’) to the R
(‘relaxed’) conformation, which increases O2 affinity ( <em>cooperative
binding</em> ), causing the characteristic shape of the <strong>oxyhaemoglobin
dissociation curve</strong> .</p>

<p>Functions: O2 transport, CO2 transport ( <strong>Haldane effect</strong> ),
buffering, and O2 demand-delivery coupling through release of NO in
hypoxic conditions.</p>
