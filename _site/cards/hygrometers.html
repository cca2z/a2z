<p><strong>Hygrometers</strong></p>

<p>- Hair hygrometer: hair increases in length at higher humidity.</p>

<p>- Regnaultâ€™s hygrometer: silver vessel filled with ether, air bubbled
through it until it cools down so much that water vapour condenses on
the tube (dew point). Humidity read from tables (see SVP).</p>

<p>- Wet and dry bulb hygrometer. Two thermometers, one has moist wick
around the bulb. Wet bulb is colder because of water evaporation; rate
of evaporation is determined by humidity. Humidity read from tables.</p>

<p>- Electrical transducers - utilise compound whose resistance changes
with humidity, eg. Lithium chloride. LiCl.</p>
