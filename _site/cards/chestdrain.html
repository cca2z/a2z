<h1 id="chest-drain">Chest drain</h1>

<p><strong>Chest drain</strong> Usually in 4 <sup>th</sup> to 6 <sup>th</sup>
<strong>intercostal space</strong> , anterior to the mid-axillary line (or the
anterior border of latissimus dorsi), posterior to pectoralis major (the
safe triangle). Underwater seal must meet certain requirements:</p>

<p>- volume of water in bottle must be more than ½ patient’s maximum
inspired volume</p>

<p>- volume of air in chest tube must also be more than ½ of patient’s
maximum inspired volume</p>

<p>- Bottle should be more than 80cm below chest (because inspiratory
pressures of -60cmH2O can be generated in some cases)</p>

<p>- Tube should be less than 5cm below water level so that gas can bubble
out freely.</p>

<p>3-bottle suction system: TRAP - SEAL - SUCK.</p>

<p>In 1-bottle system, only the seal is used. Depth of the tube tip
determines pressure that must be overcome for drainage to occur. Should
be &lt; 5cmH <sub>2</sub> O.xxx</p>
