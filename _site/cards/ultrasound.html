<h1 id="ultrasound">Ultrasound</h1>

<p><strong>Ultrasound</strong> is sound frequency too high to be audible by humans
(&gt;20kHz). Higher frequency means shorter <strong>wavelength</strong> , which means
higher resolution but less penetration. Ultrasound is generated by
<em>piezoelectric</em> crystals which vibrate when a voltage is put across
them. The same crystals convert the reflected sound waves into a votage
signal. (Ultrasound probes transmit for about 1Î¼sec and then receive for
about 1msec.)</p>

<p>Two pieces of information are extracted from the wave:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The time delay before the reflected wave is detected - this depends
on the <em>distance</em> travelled</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intensity of the wave - this depends on the echo-reflectivity of
the tissue.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
