<h1 id="local-anaesthetics">Local Anaesthetics</h1>

<p><strong>Local Anaesthetics</strong> act by blocking Na+ channels on nerve axons after
diffusing across the axonal membrane. They are weak bases so they are
more ionised in the relatively acidic intracellular space.</p>

<p>Lipid solubility determines potency.</p>

<p>Lower pKa determines faster onset.</p>

<p>Protein binding determines duration of action.</p>

<p>Structure consists of an aromatic group bound to a hydrophilic group by
an ester or amide bond.</p>

<p>Esters: Amethocaine, procaine, cocaine (??dibucaine) - metabolised in
plasma (not cocaine) and by hepatic esterases.</p>

<p>Amides Prilocaine, lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine are metabolised
by amidases xxx xxx xxx check!</p>

<p>Mechanism of action Na++ channels xxx</p>
