<p><strong>Pregnancy, non-obstetric surgery</strong> Main problems are:</p>

<p>- Teratogenicity (main concern in 1 <sup>st</sup> trimester)</p>

<p>- Premature labour (main concern in 2 <sup>nd</sup> trimester), may be
precipitated by surgery but this is unusual with the exception of
cervical xxx</p>

<p>- Foetal hypoxia (main concern in late pregnancy). Ion trapping of
opiates in the foetus is a concern immediately before birth.</p>
