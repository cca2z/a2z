<h1 id="filters">Filters</h1>

<p><strong>Filters</strong> Four important principles are used by anaesthetic <em>dry gas</em>
filters to remove particles (S-I-D-E):</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em><span class="underline">S</span> ieve</em> effect - pores prevent
passage of particles bigger than the maximum pore diameter. However, dry
gas filters rely on the other three mechanisms and have a wide range of
pore sizes in the mesh.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><span class="underline">I</span> nertial collection</em> - channels
through filter are convoluted, and particles are heavier than gas so
they accumulate on corners in the channels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><span class="underline">D</span> iffusional impaction</em> - small
(&lt;0.5μm) particles are caught on the sides of pores as they bounce
around due to Brownian motion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em><span class="underline">E</span> lectrostatic</em> - charge differences
between particles and filter membranes cause attraction.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Hygroscopic (absorbs water from atmosphere) element is added to provide
heat and moisture exchange (see <strong>Humidification</strong> ).</p>

<p>Breathing system filters are of two types:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Hydrophobic: pleated hydrophobic fibres prevent water from carrying
particles through filter. Very small pores.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Electrostatic: extra charge is applied to fibres to enhance
electrostatic effect. Large pores.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Breathing system filters should filter out particles &gt;2 μm diameter</p>
