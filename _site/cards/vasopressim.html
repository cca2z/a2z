<h1 id="vasopressim">Vasopressim</h1>

<p>VASST - hint of benefit if given early (in less severe shock); less renal injury.
VANISH -
VANCS - less acute renal failure after cardiac surgery; less atrial fibrillation vs norad.
IPDMA - VANISH, VASST, VANCS: no survival difference <em>at all</em>; significant reduction in RRT requirement, narrowly significant. More digital ischaemia, less arrythmia.</p>

<p>Modified Sgarbossa Criteria:
≥ 1 lead with ≥1 mm of concordant ST elevation
≥ 1 lead of V1-V3 with ≥ 1 mm of concordant ST depression
≥ 1 lead anywhere with ≥ 1 mm STE and proportionally excessive discordant STE, as defined by ≥ 25% of the depth of the preceding S-wave.</p>

<p>Urinary antigen tests available for:
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1.</p>

<p>Bellomo. TRPF para amino hippuric acid 1970s TRPF is elevated in sepsis. But efferent dilation is greater so decreased GFR. In sheep, reversed by angiotensin II.</p>

<p>Shunt vessels exist between afferent and efferent arterioles. Arne Lundquist 1970s. Ludwig 1911. “Ludwig’s arteriole”</p>

<p>Kids at risk of hyponatraemia due to nonphysiological ADH secretion (very common indeed, caused by nausea/distress) and at risk of complications due to higher brain:box ratio.</p>

<p>Neuromuscular disorders
MND: ddx als, polio, West Nile, paraneoplastic
NMJ: ddx myasthenia, ELMS, botulism, organophosphate, snake bite</p>

<p>GBS: weakness, areflexia, tingling and pain. Usually ascending. But bulbar variants exist.
Complications - autonomic instability,
Ileus leading to stercoperforation and death. Neuropathic pain.
Sux hyperkalaemia
Ddx: transverse myelitis, heavy metal poisoning, other nmd disorders above</p>

<p>Rx.
IVIG. Pooled from thousands of donors. Give once. Causes AKI.
Plasma exchange
Early trache.
Don’t push them too hard weaning
Wean at 15ml/kg (about a litre) vital capacity</p>

<p>Myasthenia gravis:
Fatiguability. Younger women, older men.
Normal reflexes, no sensory involvement.
15-20% thymoma.
Rx
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (if too much, SLUDGE) . Steroids, IVIG, plex. Azathioprine, rituximab</p>
