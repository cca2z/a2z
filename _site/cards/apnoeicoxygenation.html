<h1 id="apnoeic-oxygenation">Apnoeic oxygenation</h1>

<p><strong>Apnoeic oxygenation</strong> (eg. during <strong>brain stem death testing</strong> ) does
not occur by diffusion. It occurs by mass transfer of oxygen. 100%
oxygen (in a pre-oxygenated patient) flows into the lungs down a
pressure gradient. The VCO<sub>2</sub> (eg. 200ml/min) is dissolved in
total body water, and equilibrates with alveolar gas. The PaCO2 rises by
approximately 0.5kPa/min. If FRC = 2000ml, then 10ml/min CO2 will be
added to FRC. PCO<sub>2</sub>/P<sub>B</sub> = 0.5/101.3. Multiply by
2000ml = 10ml.</p>

<p>Therefore roughly 250ml/min ( <strong>VO<sub>2</sub></strong> ) is removed from the
alveoli by blood flow, and this is only replaced with around 10mls of
CO2 from metabolism. Gas from the higher airways flows into the alveoli
to replace the deficit.</p>
