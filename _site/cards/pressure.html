<h1 id="pressure">Pressure</h1>

<p><strong>Pressure</strong> is force per unit area. 1Pa = 1N/m <sup>2</sup> . Because
force has a vector (ie. it acts in a given direction), so does pressure
<em>.</em> This is key to understanding the <strong>Venturi</strong> effect.</p>

<p>Units of pressure</p>

<p>1 bar = 100kPa</p>

<p>1 atmosphere = 101.325kPa</p>
