<h1 id="catecholamines">Catecholamines</h1>

<p><strong>Catecholamines</strong> are synthesised in the adrenal medulla and in
neurones. They are taken up into nerve endings by uptake 1 (slow,
noradrenaline-selective, inhibited by cocaine) and into non-neuronal
cells by uptake 2 (rapid, adrenaline-selective) and metabolised by
catechol-o-methyl transferase (predominantly in nerve endings) and
monoamine oxidase (predominantly in liver) xxx to produce a wide range
of metabolites including vanillomandelic acid (VMA), which is excreted
in urine.</p>
