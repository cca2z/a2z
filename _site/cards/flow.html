<h1 id="flow">Flow</h1>

<p><strong>Flow</strong> (Q) (see <strong>flowmeters</strong> ).</p>

<p>Laminar [Hagen-P…] Q= πΔP*r <sup>4</sup> /8*viscosity*length</p>

<p>Reynold’s number (&gt;2000 higher probability of turbulence)
Re=DVD/viscosity (imagine a DVD dropped on a pile of jam).</p>

<p>Turbulent Q varies as √ΔP*r <sup>2</sup> /ρ*l</p>

<p>The important factors to take from this are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Flow is highly dependent on radius</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A less DENSE fluid, eg Helium, is less likely to have turbulence, and
flows faster when flow is turbulent.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
