<p><strong>Thyroid hormones</strong> are systhesised …xxx</p>

<p>Iodine → iodide (carbimazole inhibits)</p>

<p>Mono- and Di-iodothryronine synthesised from Tyrosine</p>

<p>Pair of MIT and DIT combined by thyroid peroxidase (propylthiouracil
inhibits)</p>

<p>T4 and T3 released. Peripheral conversion T4 to more active T3
(inhibited by propanolol).</p>

<p>Give iv T3 to treat thryroid crisis.</p>

<p>Amiodarone causes hypothyroidism initially by precipitating the
Wolff-Chaikoff effect, which causes decreased synthesis of thyroid
hormones in context of a large iodine load.</p>
