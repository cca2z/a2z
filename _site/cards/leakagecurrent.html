<h1 id="leakage-current">Leakage current</h1>

<p><strong>Leakage current</strong> is current that flows along an alternative route
other than the designated conductors in a circuit. It may occur wherever
a potential difference occurs between electrical conductors -ie in all
electrical equipment. See <strong>microshock</strong> and <strong>electricity</strong> .</p>
