<p>CO2 ventilatory response graph. Extrapolating the lines to zero finds
the <em>apnoeic threshold</em> . Awake subjects continue to breathe below this
due to the <em>wakefulness drive to breathing</em> . Confusion about this arose
because one over-represented group of awake experimental subjects
becomes apnoeic below the apnoeic threshold: conscious adult respiratory
physiologists.</p>
