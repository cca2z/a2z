<p><strong>Fractional sodium excretion (FENa). (</strong> See <strong>renal failure - acute.</strong>
) The percentage of the sodium in the glomerular filtrate that is
excreted. Since 100% (near enough) of filtered creatinine is excreted,
FENa is calculated by ‘scaling up’ the urine:plasma sodium ratio by
multiplying it by the inverse of the urine:plasma creatinine ratio.</p>

<p>Normal PCr = 60μmol/l; normal UCr = 10mmol/l.</p>

<p>FENa &lt; 1% in pre-renal failure as normal compensation ( <strong>RAAS</strong> )
reclaims sodium from filtrate.</p>

<p>FENa &gt; 2% in acute tubular necrosis.</p>
