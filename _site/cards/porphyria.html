<h1 id="porphyria">Porphyria</h1>

<p><strong>Porphyria</strong> A group of diseases caused by enzyme defects in <strong>haem</strong>
synthesis. Intermediate compounds (porphyrins) are released into blood
causing symptoms, which range from photosensitivity to acute abdominal
pain, vomiting, acidosis(xxx), psychosis, convulsions and coma.
Peripheral and autonomic neuropathy may also occur. Diagnosis is by
detection of porphyrins in urine and stool. Two types: acute
intermittent porphyria (autosomal dominant) and variegate porphyria (xxx
inheritance) cause severe illness following anaesthesia.</p>

<p>Acute attacks are precipitated by physiological stresses including
infection, starvation, menstruation, or drugs. The <strong>enzyme inducing
drugs</strong> are particularly dangerous (PC-BRAS)(xxx check them all!). These
increase the production of D-aminolaevulinic acid (D-ALA).</p>

<p>All of the induction agents are reported to be dangerous, but propofol
and ketamine have been used safely. Opiods and suxamethonium are also
considered safe. What more do you need?</p>
