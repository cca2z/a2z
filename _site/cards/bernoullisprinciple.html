<h1 id="bernoullis-principle">Bernoulli’s principle</h1>

<p><strong>Bernoulli’s principle</strong> is that the sum of:</p>

<p>- Pressure potential energy (= P),</p>

<p>- Kinetic energy (= ½ρv <sup>2</sup> ), and</p>

<p>- Gravitational potential energy (= ρgh)</p>

<p>is constant for a given fluid.</p>

<p>P + ½ρv <sup>2\ +</sup> ρgh = k</p>

<p>This is important for two reasons. Firstly, it predicts that
fast-flowing fluids will exert less <strong>pressure</strong> on the walls of their
container. Hence the <strong>Venturi effect</strong> occurs. Secondly, the much
easier <em>modified Bernoulli equation</em> is used to predict trans-valve
pressures from measured velocity by Doppler echocardiography:</p>

<p>ΔP = 4v<sup>2</sup></p>
