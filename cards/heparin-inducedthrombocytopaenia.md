# Heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia

**Heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia** . Hypercoagulable state occurs
paradoxically in association with throbocytopaenia 4-14 days after
starting heparin. Caused by antibodies to a complex of heparin and
platelet factor 4 (PF4). This complex is both immunogenic and
stimulatory to platelets (acting via cell-surface receptor FcÎ³IIa).
