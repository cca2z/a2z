# Receptor

**Receptor** (see **drug targets** ). Cellular components bind
specifically to a **ligand** . There are three subtypes of receptor:
ligand-gated ion channels, second messenger receptors, and cytosolic
receptors.

*Ligand-gated ion channels* :

*Second messenger* :

G protein-coupled - all activate a protein kinase.

Gi - ↓ adenylate cyclase, ↓ cAMP. Protein Kinase A.

Gs - ↑adenylate cyclase, ↑cAMP. Protein Kinase A.

Gq - ↑phospholipase C, ↑ IP3 + DAG. Protein Kinase C.

G xxx - ↑guanylyl cyclase, ↑cGMP. Protein Kinase G.

Tyrosine Kinase: direct action phosphorylate proteins.

*Cytosolic* :

Steroid receptors
