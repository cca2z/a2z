# Nucleic acids

**Nucleic acids** are made up of bases (eg. adenine) bound to ribose or
deoxyribose to make a nucleoside (eg. adenosine) and phosphorylated at
the 5' or 3' position to make a nucleotide. Bases can be purines
(adenine, guanine) or pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, uracil).

Pyrimidines: Thymine production requires **folate** , and is prevented
by inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (eg. Methotrexate) or
methionine synthetase (eg. **Nitrous oxide** ).
