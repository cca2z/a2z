# MRI

**MRI** Principle: protons spin like the earth, and precess (wobble) on
their axis. A moving charge induces a magnetic field. So all protons are
like tiny, randomly aligned magnets.

In the powerful constant magnetic field in the scanner, all the protons
in a patient are assorted randomly along the longitudinal axis. A
radiofrequency (RF) pulse is fired across the patient from a coil,
causing the protons to line up transversely, and in synchrony. When the
RF pulse ceases, the protons return to the longitudinal arrangement. As
they do so they release energy, causing two detectable signals:

T1 - return of the longitudinal magnetic field.

T2 - loss of the transverse magnetic field.

The scan sequence can be altered to detect each of these signals. On
T1-weighted scans fat is bright, water is dark, grey matter is grey, and
white matter is white. On T2-weighted scans, fat is bright, water is
bright, grey matter is grey, and white matter is dark. Cortical bone is
always dark, since the protons are immobile, and air is dark, because
there are very few protons.

Anaesthesia for MRI has numerous difficulties:

\- remote, cramped, and unfamiliar site

\- ferromagnetic objects accelerate in the magnetic field

\- the magnetic field induces a current in electrical wires, interfering
with monitoring and potentially causing burns on the patient.

\- **Pacemakers** will initiate their programmed 'magnet response'.
