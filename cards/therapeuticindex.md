# Therapeutic index

**Therapeutic index** is the ratio of the toxic dose to the therapeutic
dose. For consistency, these are taken as the TD <sub>50</sub> - the
dose at which 50% of *population* get toxicity and **ED <sub>50</sub>**
- the minimum dose to have desired effect in 50% of *population* .

Therapeutic index = TD <sub>50</sub> /ED <sub>50</sub>
