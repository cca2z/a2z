# Stress response

**Stress response** to surgery, trauma, or burns is similar (xxx - how
similar?). Modifying it is often attempted, with mixed results. The core
elements are:

\- Acute phase response

\- Sympathetic nervous system activation

\- Sympathetic **RAAS** activation

\- **Hypothalamic** - **Pituitary** - **Adrenal** axis

\- Insulin

\- Vasopressin

Response is attenuated by regional anaesthesia or high dose opiates.
This may be desirable.
