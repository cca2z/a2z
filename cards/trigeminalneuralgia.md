# Trigeminal neuralgia

**Trigeminal neuralgia** sudden, episodic, unilateral lancinating pain
in the distribution of one or more branches of the **trigeminal nerve**
. Extreme severity; suicide is reported. Drug treatment is with
**anticonvulsants** such as carbamazepine, gabapentin, phenytoin.
Baclofen is also used. None are very effective. Surgical treatment
includes craniotomy for microvascular decompression in which the root of
the trigeminal nerve is released from compression by blood vessels such
as an ecstatic superior cerebellar artery. 90% of patients have complete
resolution of symptoms immediately after this.
