# Doppler

**Doppler** shift is measured by the equation

F <sub>d</sub> = (2F <sub>o</sub> /c)VcosΘ

F <sub>d</sub> - frequency shift

F <sub>o</sub> - transmitted frequency

C - velocity of sound in blood

V - velocity of flow

Θ - angle of US beam to flow

BART convention: blue away, red towards.
