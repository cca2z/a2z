# Valvular heart disease

**Valvular heart disease** xxx

Symptomatic or severe valvular heart disease is a major risk factor for
peri-operative death (see **cardiac risk** ). Basic principles are the
same for all forms: maintain coronary perfusion, maintain myocardial
contractility. Control preload, heart rate, and afterload.

See individual ones. xxx
