# Hippuric acid

**Hippuric acid** is a metabolite of toluene, and causes a metabolic
acidosis in glue sniffers. It is freely filtered and efficiently
secreted by the kidney, so that all of the hippuric acid that enters the
kidney in the blood, leaves it in the urine. Therefore hippuric acid
clearance = renal plasma flow. (Multiply by 1/(1-haematocrit) to get
renal blood flow.) Because hippurate ions are so rapidly cleared from
plasma, the **anion gap** is normal, even though the acidosis is caused
by an exogenous weak acid.
