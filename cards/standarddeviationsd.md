# Standard deviation (SD)

**Standard deviation (SD)** is a measure of the *spread* of values in a
data set. If data conform to the **normal distribution** , then 70% of
the values lie within 1 SD of the mean, and 95% of the values are within
2 SD of the mean. The standard deviation expressed as a percentage of
the mean, is called the *coefficient of variation* .
