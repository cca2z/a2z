# Ventilatory response graphs

**Ventilatory response graphs**

CO2 ventilatory response graph. Extrapolating the lines to zero finds
the *apnoeic threshold* . Awake subjects continue to breathe below this
due to the *wakefulness drive to breathing* . Confusion about this arose
because one over-represented group of awake experimental subjects
becomes apnoeic below the apnoeic threshold: conscious adult respiratory
physiologists.
