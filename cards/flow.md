# Flow

**Flow** (Q) (see **flowmeters** ).

Laminar \[Hagen-P…\] Q= πΔP\*r <sup>4</sup> /8\*viscosity\*length

Reynold's number (&gt;2000 higher probability of turbulence)
Re=DVD/viscosity (imagine a DVD dropped on a pile of jam).

Turbulent Q varies as √ΔP\*r <sup>2</sup> /ρ\*l

The important factors to take from this are:

1. Flow is highly dependent on radius

2. A less DENSE fluid, eg Helium, is less likely to have turbulence, and
flows faster when flow is turbulent.
