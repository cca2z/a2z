# Baroreceptors

**Baroreceptors** (see **Valsalva manoeuvre** ) Arterial baroreceptors
are phasic (as opposed to tonic) receptors so they respond profoundly to
*change* in pressure, and only weakly to *absolute* pressure. This means
that the strength of the pulsation is sensed more accurately than the
pressure, suggesting that evolution is more interested in cardiac output
than blood pressure. xxx

Afferent signals from aortic arch baroreceptors travel in the vagus, and
from carotid body baroreceptors in the glossopharangeal nerve. Signals
are integrated in the vasomotor centre in the medulla.

Nucleus tractus solitarius.

Unclamping tonic inhibition.

Cardiac output is regulated.
