# Chest drain

**Chest drain** Usually in 4 <sup>th</sup> to 6 <sup>th</sup>
**intercostal space** , anterior to the mid-axillary line (or the
anterior border of latissimus dorsi), posterior to pectoralis major (the
safe triangle). Underwater seal must meet certain requirements:

\- volume of water in bottle must be more than ½ patient's maximum
inspired volume

\- volume of air in chest tube must also be more than ½ of patient's
maximum inspired volume

\- Bottle should be more than 80cm below chest (because inspiratory
pressures of -60cmH2O can be generated in some cases)

\- Tube should be less than 5cm below water level so that gas can bubble
out freely.

3-bottle suction system: TRAP - SEAL - SUCK.

In 1-bottle system, only the seal is used. Depth of the tube tip
determines pressure that must be overcome for drainage to occur. Should
be &lt; 5cmH <sub>2</sub> O.xxx
