# One-lung ventilation

**One-lung ventilation** is indicated for….

*<span class="underline">Surgical access</span>* : VATS, TAAA,
Pneumonectomy / lobectomy, oesophagectomy, bronchial surgery,
mediastinal surgery.

: infection, haemorrhage

*<span class="underline">Protect sick lung</span>* :

● Unilateral cyst/bulla

● Unilateral bronchial lavage

*<span class="underline">Improve ventilation/gas exchange</span>* :

● Bronchial injury

● B-P fistula

● Hypoxia due to unilateral lung disease

Management of hypoxia during one-lung ventilation.

1. Oxygenation/ventilation of the *<span class="underline">unventilated
lung</span>* :

● Increase F <sub>I</sub> O<sub>2</sub> to the ventilated lung
(relatively ineffective because of the physiology of **shunt** ) xxx

● Low flow O<sub>2</sub> for apnoeic oxygenation

● Interrupting surgery for intermittent ventilation of the lung

● Some thoracic surgery will be unaffected by continuous ventilation
both lungs

2. *<span class="underline">Decrease shunt</span>* flow by clamping
pulmonary artery to unventilated lung

3. *<span class="underline">Increase cardiac output</span>* . This
improves tissue oxygen delivery, so the **tissue oxygen extraction** is
less, so venous blood has a higher C <sub>v</sub> O<sub>2</sub> ,
