# Muscular dystrophy

**Muscular dystrophy** Duchenne: X-linked, severe: onset age 3-4,
wheelchair-bound by age 10, death from respiratory or cardiac failure
often before age 20.

Becker: 'Benign X-linked': onset age 5-20, usually wheelchair-bound
after 25 years of disease.

Examination: male child, waddling lordotic gait. Similar, rarer
conditions may affect girls.

Abnormality in both diseases is in the *dystrophin gene* , which codes
for a muscle cytoskeletal protein important in interaction of
sarcoplasmic reticulum with plasma membrane.

Anaesthetic problems:

\- Respiratory failure, kyphoscoliosis

\- Rhabdomyolysis precipitated by suxamethonium or prolonged exposure to
**inhalational anaesthetics** (this is not MH, but is similar).

\- Cardiomyopathy.

\- Delayed gastric emptying.
