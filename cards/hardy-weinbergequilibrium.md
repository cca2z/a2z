# Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium

**Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium** is a get-out-of-jail-free card for any
question about a recessive disorder. Population frequency of dominant
allele = p; frequency of recessive allele = q. **Probability** of each
genotype is in brackets:

Therefore, for any population:

p <sup>2</sup> + 2pq + q <sup>2</sup> = 1
