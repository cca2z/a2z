# Chi-squared test

**Chi-squared test** applies to a 2 x 2 table, eg.:

Examines whether there is an association between the row variable and
the column variable. It compares the *observed* data with the results
*expected if there were no association:*

(observed-expected) <sup>2</sup> /expected

This is done for each of the four squares in the table, and the results
are all added together:

Χ <sup>2</sup> = ∑ (O-E) <sup>2</sup> /E

The significance value is then read from a table of the Chi distribution
(higher Χ <sup>2</sup> = lower p-value). If there are less than 20
subjects then *Fisher's exact test* is used.
