# Sugammadex

**Sugammadex** Reversal agent for **neuromuscular blockers,** superior
to **anticholinesterases** because it does not have a *ceiling effect* .
A modified γ-cyclodextrin (therefore it is 8 glucose molecules in a ring
structure). C <sub>72</sub> H <sub>104</sub> O <sub>48</sub> S
<sub>8</sub> Na <sub>8</sub> ; MW=2178Da).

\[sketch of 8 rings, 8 sulphurs on 8 negatively charged hydrophilic side
chains, hydrophobic cavity\]

Encapsulates rocuronium (MW=610Da) and vecuronium, binds them avidly
with:

\- Van der Waals forces

\- Hydrophobic attraction

\- Electrostatic attraction

…and so rapidly decreases the concentration of free rocuronium in blood,
creating a large gradient for the diffusion of rocuronium away from the
NMJ. The complex is water soluble and renally excreted.

May also encapsulate (with much less affinity):

Verapamil

Oestrogens (possibly contraceptive hormones)

Cortisol

Atropine Large doses cause hypotension, QT prolongation.
