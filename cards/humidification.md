# Humidification

**Humidification** of inspired gases.

Direct injection of water/saline - risk of flooding airway

HME - **hygroscopic** element with low resistance and minimal deadspace.
Often combined with a **filter** .

Cold water bath - bubble gas through water. Inefficient.

Heated water bath- very efficient. Risk of flooding airway or tubing.
