# Units

**Units** In the SI system, there are 7 base units:

Potential difference = power/current = current\*resistance
(Haemodynamics: Pressure difference = flow\*resistance).

Work = force\*distance (Physiology: work = pressure\*volume

Charge is number of electrons xxx. 1 coulomb is quantity of charge
passing a single point when 1A flows for 1s. (=6x10 <sup>18</sup>
electrons).

Capacitance = charge/voltage. 1 farad is one coulomb stored per volt
applied.(Haemodynamics: Capacitance = volume stored/pressure.)

Energy stored in a capacitor = Â½CV <sub>2</sub>

Force = mass \* acceleration. 1 Newton is the force required to
accelerate a mass of 1kg at 1m/s <sup>2</sup> .

Energy= work = force x distance. 1J = 1Nm. 1 Joule is the energy
expended when an object subjected to a force of 1N moves 1m in the
direction of the force. (Work=F\*d).

Power = energy/time. 1W=1J/s.
