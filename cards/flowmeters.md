# Flowmeters

**Flowmeters** (How is flow measured? Answer 1. Flowmeters; 2.
Physiological methods - see cardiac output)

\- **Constant orifice, variable pressure** eg.

o Pneumotachograph: A device for measuring flow. Measures the difference
in pressure across a fixed orifice. Radius and length are known,
viscosity is assumed, so flow can be calculated by **Hagen-Poisei** â€¦
(see Flow).

o Simple pressure gauge downstream from a known pressure and known
resistance (eg outlet from gas cylinder).

\- **Variable orifice, constant pressure** eg.:

o **Rotameter** : the tube is tapered so that the orifice is larger the
higher the bobbin moves. The pressure behind the bobbin supports its
weight; when flow is increased, the pressure behind the bobbin
increases, so the bobbin accelerates upwards until the orifice size is
large enough that the pressure behind the bobbin is only sufficient to
support the bobbin's weight.

o Wright Peak flow meter
