# Acetylcholine receptors (AChR)

**Acetylcholine receptors (AChR)**

Muscarinic - G-protein coupled. Present at organ

Nicotinic - ligand-gated Na+ channel. 3 types of nicotinic AChR: muscle,
ganglionic, and neuronal.

5 subunits:

α, β, α, δ, ε in adults - high conductance, short duration

α β α γ δ in foetus - low conductance, long duration
