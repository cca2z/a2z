# Partial pressure of a gas dissolved in a liquid

**Partial pressure of a gas dissolved in a liquid** is a perplexing
concept: it is defined as being equal to the partial pressure of that
gas in a mixture of gases in equilibrium with the liquid. Normally there
is a linear relationship between partial pressure the and dissolved gas
content ( **Henry's law** ) but this is not the case with oxygen (see
**Haemoglobin** ) or **carbon dioxide** dissolving in blood.
