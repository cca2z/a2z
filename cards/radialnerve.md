# Radial nerve

**Radial nerve** arises from the posterior cord of the **brachial
plexus** and runs deep to the axillary artery before passing behind the
humerus in the spiral groove. It then enters the **antecubital fossa**
between brachialis and brachioradialis where it divides into terminal
branches. The xxx branch follows lateral to the radial artery into the
hand.

It provides motor innervation to the extensors of the forearm and hand.
Cutaneous sensory distribution is limited xxx, but deep sensation covers
much of the hand and radial side of the forearm.
