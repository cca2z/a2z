# Tricyclic antidepressants

**Tricyclic antidepressants** (see **antidepressants** ). Toxicity is
primarily mediated through Type 1a **antiarrythmic** action.
**Anticholinergic** signs are present, and sedation results from
antihistamine action. Sudden deterioration is common.

QRS duration QRS &gt;100ms predicts arrhythmia. Also S <sub>1</sub>
pattern, R wave in AVR.

Management centres on aggressive cardiovascular resuscitation with
fluid, NaHCO <sub>3</sub> , and noradrenaline to maintain MAP.

NaHCO <sub>3</sub> narrows the QRS complex and improves blood pressure.
The probable mechanism is an increase in the neutral form of the TCA,
which reduces binding to Na <sup>+</sup> channels.
