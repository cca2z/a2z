# Cervical spine injury

**Cervical spine injury** Clearing the C-spine in an unconscious patient
is difficult. C-spine CT with 3D reconstruction is generally considered
adequate.

Problems:

A - Denervation hyperkalaemia following suxamethonium does not usually
onset until 48h after injury.

Resp - C3,4,5 innervate **diaphragm** . Accessory muscles innervated by
cervical and thoracic nerves. These may contribute 60% of tidal volume
in some patients.

CVS - neurogenic shock secondary to sympathetic denervation.

Other: ileus is common; DVT prophylaxis mandatory.
