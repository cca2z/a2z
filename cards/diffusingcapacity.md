# Diffusing capacity

**Diffusing capacity** commonly measured across the lung for carbon
monoxide (D <sub>L</sub> CO). Has two components: diffusion across the
membrane (DM) and binding to haemoglobin (θV <sub>C</sub> ; reaction
rate= θ; capillary blood volume = V <sub>C</sub> )(diffusion in plasma
is negligible). DLCO is a like a conductance, so the reciprocal of it is
a resistance. Resistances in series are summative, so:

1/D <sub>L</sub> CO = 1/D <sub>M</sub> + 1/θV <sub>C</sub>

θ varies with F <sub>I</sub> O<sub>2</sub> . Therefore, to calculate D
<sub>M</sub> , take two DL <sub>C</sub> O measurements are different F
<sub>I</sub> O<sub>2</sub> , plot 1/θ against D <sub>L</sub> CO, and
extrapolate to where 1/θ = 0. (ie θ = ∞ ). Thus 1/θV <sub>C</sub> = 0,
so D <sub>L</sub> CO = DM. \[check !‼\]
