# Ultrasound

**Ultrasound** is sound frequency too high to be audible by humans
(&gt;20kHz). Higher frequency means shorter **wavelength** , which means
higher resolution but less penetration. Ultrasound is generated by
*piezoelectric* crystals which vibrate when a voltage is put across
them. The same crystals convert the reflected sound waves into a votage
signal. (Ultrasound probes transmit for about 1Î¼sec and then receive for
about 1msec.)

Two pieces of information are extracted from the wave:

1. The time delay before the reflected wave is detected - this depends
on the *distance* travelled

2. The intensity of the wave - this depends on the echo-reflectivity of
the tissue.
