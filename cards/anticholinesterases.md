# Anticholinesterases

**Anticholinesterases** used to reverse neuromuscular blockade, diagnose
and treat myasthenia gravis. Disadvantages include cholinergic side
effects and the *ceiling effect*: effectiveness is limited by the amount
of ACh the patient can release from nerve terminals.

(see **organophosphate poisoning**).
