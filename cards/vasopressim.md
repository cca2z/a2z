# Vasopressim

VASST - hint of benefit if given early (in less severe shock); less renal injury.
VANISH -
VANCS - less acute renal failure after cardiac surgery; less atrial fibrillation vs norad.
IPDMA - VANISH, VASST, VANCS: no survival difference *at all*; significant reduction in RRT requirement, narrowly significant. More digital ischaemia, less arrythmia.

Modified Sgarbossa Criteria:
≥ 1 lead with ≥1 mm of concordant ST elevation
≥ 1 lead of V1-V3 with ≥ 1 mm of concordant ST depression
≥ 1 lead anywhere with ≥ 1 mm STE and proportionally excessive discordant STE, as defined by ≥ 25% of the depth of the preceding S-wave.

Urinary antigen tests available for:
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1.

Bellomo. TRPF para amino hippuric acid 1970s TRPF is elevated in sepsis. But efferent dilation is greater so decreased GFR. In sheep, reversed by angiotensin II.

Shunt vessels exist between afferent and efferent arterioles. Arne Lundquist 1970s. Ludwig 1911. "Ludwig's arteriole"

Kids at risk of hyponatraemia due to nonphysiological ADH secretion (very common indeed, caused by nausea/distress) and at risk of complications due to higher brain:box ratio.

Neuromuscular disorders
MND: ddx als, polio, West Nile, paraneoplastic
NMJ: ddx myasthenia, ELMS, botulism, organophosphate, snake bite

GBS: weakness, areflexia, tingling and pain. Usually ascending. But bulbar variants exist.
Complications - autonomic instability,
Ileus leading to stercoperforation and death. Neuropathic pain.
Sux hyperkalaemia
Ddx: transverse myelitis, heavy metal poisoning, other nmd disorders above
