# Immunosuppression

Azathioprine: metabolised to 6-mercaptopurine by liver, inhibits purine
metabolism (azathioPURine), so prevents clonal expansion of T- and B-
cells. (See **nucleic acids** )

Mycophenolate mofetil: an alternative to azathioprine.

Cyclosporin: xxx calcineurin inhibitor? highly nephrotoxic, very
variable oral absorption. Therefore give it *iv* around surgery; check
blood levels. Numerous drug interactions.

Tacrolimus: an alternative to cyclosporin. xxx calcineurin inhibitor?

Prednisolone: steroid side-effects. Increase dose around surgery.
