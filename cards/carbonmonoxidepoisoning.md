# Carbon monoxide poisoning

**Carbon monoxide poisoning** CO binds avidly to Hb (affinity 240x &gt;
O<sub>2</sub>) forming carboxyhaemoglobin COHb.

Brain injury occurs. 3% die, 33% have neurological symptoms at 1yr if
treated with 100% O2 (half that many if treated with hyperbaric O2).

Causes hypoxia (COHb, leftshift HC curve)

Lipid peroxidation (immune activation)

Inhibits cytochrome c (see **mitochondrial metabolism** )

t <sub>Â½</sub> of COHb is: 240 minutes breathing air, 40 minutes
breathing 100% O<sub>2</sub> , and 20 minutes on 100% O<sub>2</sub> at 3
atm.
