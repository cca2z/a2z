# Fade

**Fade** decrease in amplitude of muscle twitches on train-of-four (TOF)
or double-burst stimulation (DBS) testing that occurs with partial
non-depolarising neuromuscular blockade, or phase II block with a
**depolarising muscle relaxant** .

Normally, 50 fewer ACh vesicles are released with each depolarisation
(at 2Hz), but because 5x more ACh is released than is needed for
contraction, fade isn't seen unless there is substantial receptor
occupancy (see **Michaelis-Menten** ):

1 twitch &gt; 95% receptor occupancy

2 twitches &gt; 90%

3 twitches &gt; 80%

4 twitches &lt;70%
