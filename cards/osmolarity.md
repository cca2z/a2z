# Osmolarity

**Osmolarity** is number of osmoles in a litre of specific solvent

*Osmolality* is number of osmoles xxx in a kilogram of xxx.

*Osmotic pressure* is the hydrostatic pressure required to oppose
movement of water across a semipermeable membrane to or from a given
solution. This assumes an ideal membrane permeable only to water.

*Tonicity* is effective osmolality at a real cell membrane. Some
molecules, such as glucose, move across the cell membrane, so they are
*ineffective* *osmoles* and hence contribute little to tonicity.

Van't Hoff's law osmotic pressure π = ΘciRT.

Osmolarity = Θci

Mystery is Θ. This corrects for the difference in behaviour of real
solutions from ideal. Eg. NaCl Θ = 0.93. So for a 154mM solution of
NaCl, osmolality is 286, not 308 as predicted.

Colligative properties are dependent on concentration rather than
chemical properties. They are: osmotic pressure, freezing point
depression, vapour pressure depression, increase in boiling point.

In °C, ΔTf = 1.86 Θci

From NPSA report on hypotonic saline in kids: \[xxx note that osmolarity
is wrong since Θ is not taken into account\]
