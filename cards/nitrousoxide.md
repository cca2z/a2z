# Nitrous oxide

**Nitrous oxide** is the only drug that has been used continuously
throughout the history of anaesthesia. Intrinsic NMDA antagonism which
may cause neurotoxicity that is attenuated by concurrent use of GABA
agonist.

Problems:

Increases **CMRO<sub>2</sub>** , CBF, and ICP.

Increased PONV

Increased pressure in enclosed gas spaces (Absolute pressure increase =
P <sub>A</sub> N <sub>2</sub> O), increased volume in compliant gas
spaces (Relative volume increase = F <sub>I</sub> N <sub>2</sub> 0/(1-F
<sub>I</sub> N <sub>2</sub> O).

Inhibits methionine synthetase, a key enzyme of **folate**
**metabolism** , causing neurologic deficits in B12-deficient patients,
and exacerbating hyperhomocysteinaemia leading to increased risk of
dementia, and **thrombembolism** .

Surgical wound infection.

See **inhalational agents.**
