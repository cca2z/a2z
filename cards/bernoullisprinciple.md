# Bernoulli's principle

**Bernoulli's principle** is that the sum of:

\- Pressure potential energy (= P),

\- Kinetic energy (= ½ρv <sup>2</sup> ), and

\- Gravitational potential energy (= ρgh)

is constant for a given fluid.

P + ½ρv <sup>2\ +</sup> ρgh = k

This is important for two reasons. Firstly, it predicts that
fast-flowing fluids will exert less **pressure** on the walls of their
container. Hence the **Venturi effect** occurs. Secondly, the much
easier *modified Bernoulli equation* is used to predict trans-valve
pressures from measured velocity by Doppler echocardiography:

ΔP = 4v<sup>2</sup>
