# Hypertension

**Hypertension** should be treated elective surgery if it is greater
than 180/110 or if there is end-organ damage (LVH, renal failure,
retinopathy).

Grade 1: SBP &gt; 140 or DBP &gt; 90

Grade 2: SBP &gt; 160 or DBP &gt; 100

Grade 3: SBP &gt; 180 or DBP &gt; 110.

Hypertension associated with acute organ famage (AKI, pulmonary oedema,
aortic dissection, ACS) should be treated with intravenous therapy. In
acute stroke, BP should be controlled (15% reduction per 24h) if:

&gt;220/120

&gt;185/110 if thrombolysis indicated (NB Plts&lt;100)

&gt;180/105 after thrombolysis
