# Local Anaesthetics

**Local Anaesthetics** act by blocking Na+ channels on nerve axons after
diffusing across the axonal membrane. They are weak bases so they are
more ionised in the relatively acidic intracellular space.

Lipid solubility determines potency.

Lower pKa determines faster onset.

Protein binding determines duration of action.

Structure consists of an aromatic group bound to a hydrophilic group by
an ester or amide bond.

Esters: Amethocaine, procaine, cocaine (??dibucaine) - metabolised in
plasma (not cocaine) and by hepatic esterases.

Amides Prilocaine, lidocaine, ropivacaine, bupivacaine are metabolised
by amidases xxx xxx xxx check!

Mechanism of action Na++ channels xxx
