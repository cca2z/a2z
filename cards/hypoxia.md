\[graph of O2 cascade\]

Hypoxaemia can only occur if blood somehow gets past the lungs without
taking on oxygen.

Hypobaric hypoxia or breathing hypoxic gas

Hypoventilation - see **alveolar gas equation**

Venous admixture -

**Shunt**

Carriage - anaemia/ MetHb/ COHb.

Cytotoxic hypoxia -oxygen delivery is normal to cells but mitochondrial
metabolism fails to utilise oxygen.
