# Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)

**Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET)** is used to identify
high-risk patients undergoing surgery. Thresholds: VO<sub>2</sub> max
&lt;15 mlO2/kg/min or anaerobic threshold &lt;11 mlO<sub>2</sub> /kg/min
predict high risk. A metabolic equivalent (met) is a given patient's
metabolic rate at rest. It usually equates to 3.5 mlO2/kg/min. xxx ref
