# GABA <sub>A</sub> receptors

**GABA <sub>A</sub> receptors** . Inhibitory ligand-gated ion channel.
Site of action of most anaesthetic agents.

2α 2β 1γ subunits. Many different subtypes of each subunit (eg. α1 are
sedative, α2 anxiolytic, and α3 myorelaxant).

Benzodiazepines bind to α subunits and increase frequency of channel
opening. Barbiturates bind to β subunits and increase duration of
opening.
