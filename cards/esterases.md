# Esterases

**Esterases** Three types are important:

1. Acetylcholinesterase - hydrolyses ACh in nerve endings

2. Plasma cholinesterase is also call pseudocholinesterase or
butyrylcholinesterase. It circulates in plasma, and hydrolyses
**suxamethonium** and mivacurium.

3. Non-specific plasma esterases. Hydrolyse esmolol, remifentanil.
