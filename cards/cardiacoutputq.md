# Cardiac Output (Q)

**Cardiac Output (Q)**

Important physiological equations:

*<span class="underline">Q =venous return</span>* : the heart pumps
harder if more blood flows into it ( **Frank-Starling mechanism** ). In
health, what goes in must come out.

*<span class="underline">Q=SV\*HR</span>* : mathematically correct, but
physiologically misleading. Electrical pacing an animal heart yeilds
constant cardiac output between 50 and 200 bpm.

*<span class="underline">Q=Î”P/SVR</span>* : Ohm's law. Always true, but
remember that SVR is a composite measure of many different factors,
including arteriolar resistance, viscosity
