# p

The probability that the **null hypothesis** is true. By convention, if
p &lt; 0.05, the null hypothesis is taken to be false. If multiple
comparisons are performed, the p-value for significance is divided by
the number of comparisons (eg for 5 comparisons, p &lt; 0.01 is needed
for significance; this is the *Bonferroni correction* ).
