# Area under curve (AUC)

**Area under curve (AUC)** of a graph shows x multiplied by y for a
given range. The area under a concentration-time curve can give you
cardiac output, clearance, and volume of distribution.

AUC = C\*T = M/V\*t = Mt/V

AUC/MASS = t/V

MASS/AUC = V/t = flow.

V<sub>D</sub> = Î¤\*dose/AUC
