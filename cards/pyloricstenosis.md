# Pyloric stenosis

**Pyloric stenosis** affects 4 times as many boys as girls, and 1 in 500
live births. Presents at 4 - 6 weeks with projectile vomiting after
feeds. An 'olive' may be felt in the right upper quadrant. It is a
medical but not a surgical emergency. Problems are dehydration and
electrolyte loss: ↓ K <sup>+</sup> ↓ H <sup>+</sup> ↓ Cl <sup>-</sup> .

Despite the alkalosis, urine is paradoxically acidic due to the action
of aldosterone. Pyloromyotomy is curative and may be undertaken when U+E
and ABG are normal.
