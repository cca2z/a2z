# Shunt

**Shunt** Abnormal passage of blood from one side of the circulation to
the other. Normally taken to mean right-to-left shunt: venous blood
passes from right side of heart to left side without encountering
alveolar gas. (See **V/Q mismatch** : shunt is Q without V.)
Physiological shunt occurs through bronchial circulation and Thebesian
veins.
