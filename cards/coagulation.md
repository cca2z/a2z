# Coagulation

**Coagulation** *in vivo* is a complex self-propagating interaction
between cells, clotting factors, endogenous anti-coagulants, platelets,
and fibrinolytic enzymes. It can be initiated by numerous factors
including exposure of tissue factor or collagen, and platelet
activation.

Clot formation has 5 steps:

\- *<span class="underline">Initiation</span>* (Tissue factor or
collagen. VIIa is critical, IX, and X produce small amounts of thrombin)

\- *<span class="underline">Amplification</span>* (thrombin activates
platelets and clotting factors, which in turn increase thrombin
production ( *positive feedback* ))

\- *<span class="underline">Propagation</span>* (thrombin burst)

\- *<span class="underline">Stabilisation</span>* (thrombin-activatable
fibrinolysis inhibitor)

\- *<span class="underline">Prevention</span>* of further coagulation
(activated protein C, antithrombin)
