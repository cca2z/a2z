# Nutrition

**Nutrition** Requirements per day:

Enteral nutrition reduces stress ulceration of gastric mucosa, maintains
gut perfusion, bile flow, and mucosal barrier integrity. Complications
include misplacement of NG tube, gastric stasis, diarrhoea (60% of
patients), electrolyte and LFT derangement.

Total parenteral nutrition consists of simple nutritional components:
amino acids, glucose, electrolytes, and fat emulsion (10% or 20%). It
causes impairment of innate and acquired immunity, hepatic steatosis,
cholestasis, and excess blood levels of all of the constituents:
hyperglycaemia, lipaemia, hypernatraemia.

Non-essential amino acids such as glutamate and arginine become
conditionally essential in critical illness. Glutamate is the precursor
of the intracellular antioxidant, glutathione, and is a primary energy
source for enterocytes. Arginine is the source of NO, but far from
worsening shock, current evidence suggests that arginine supplementation
may improve outcome in sepsis.
