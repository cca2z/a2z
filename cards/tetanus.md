# Tetanus

**Tetanus** caused by the spore-forming anaerobe *Clostridium tetani* ,
which produces tetanus toxin. Toxin is transported from site of
infection to spinal cord by retrograde axonal transport, where it
cleaves membrane proteins that are involved in exocytosis, primarily in
inhibitory interneurones. This causes disinhibition of motor and
autonomic neurones and increased muscle tone, spasms and autonomic
instability. Trismus, opisthotonus and risus sardonicus are often found.
Apnoeas are caused by generalised tetanic spasms.

Differential diagnosis:

Acute dystonic reactions

Dental infection (causing trismus)

Strychnine poisoning

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
