# Pain

**Pain** is an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated
with actual or potential tissue damage and described in terms of such
damage (WHO consensus statement).

Chronic pain is pain that persists after resolution of tissue damage (or
&gt;3 months). (See **neuropathic pain** ).
