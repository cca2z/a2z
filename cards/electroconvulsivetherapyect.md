# Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)

**Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)** A safe and effective treatment for
refractory depression, mania, and schizoaffective disorder. After around
5s, a 30s seizure usually occurs.

Excessive vagal activity causes bradycardia/asystole immediately
following the shock. Then catecholamine release causes ↑MAP and ↑HR by
25%. Death rate (usually from MI/arrhythmia) around 1 in 100,000.
