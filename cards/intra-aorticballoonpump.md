# Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)

**Intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP)** .

Counterpulsation in diastole increases coronary blood flow. Deflation at
onset of systole decreases afterload, improving cardiac output, which in
turn decreases preload.

Effects: ↓ SBP, ↑DBP.

Indications: myocardial ischaemia, cardiogenic shock.

Contra-indicated in **aortic regurgitation**, dissection and end-stage
disease.

\- Haemolysis decreases Hb by 5%.

\- Thrombosis is a big risk

\- Occlusion of renal arteries may occur
