# Autoregulation

**Autoregulation** of blood flow to an organ is accomplished in three
ways.

*Metabolic:* release of H+, K+, adenosine and CO2 causes vasodilation,
shear stress transduction by endothelium.

*Myogenic:* **Laplace** muscle stretch

*Neurogenic:* autonomic n.s., mainly sympathetic.

Cessation of cerebral electrical activity occurs at a CBF of about
15mls/100g/min.

Propofol improves autoregulation to brain; volatile agents impair it.
