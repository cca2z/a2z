# Ulnar nerve

**Ulnar nerve** arises from the medial cord of the **brachial plexus** .
It lies medial to the axillary artery and the brachial artery until the
lower third of the humerus, when it follows the medial head of triceps
and passes behind the medial epicondyle in the ulnar groove (the
funnybone). In the forearm it lies deep to flexor carpi ulnaris, and
lateral to the ulnar artery.

The ulnar nerve supplies all small muscles of the hand with the
exception of the LOAF muscles.
