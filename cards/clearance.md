# Clearance

**Clearance** is the volume of *plasma* cleared of a substance in a
given period of time.

By the definition of **concentration** , *for a given time period* :

Volume cleared = mass of drug removed / plasma concentration.

The name of the game is working out the mass of drug removed. For renal
clearance, this is the concentration in urine(U) x the volume of urine
produced (V).

Clearance = UV/P

For an infusion at steady state, mass of drug removed = mass of drug
infused so:

Clearance = mass infused/C <sub>P</sub> ss

For any drug,

Clearance = Dose/AUC = V <sub>D</sub> /Ï„ = mass infused/C <sub>P</sub>
ss = UV/P

(See **pharmacokinetics** , **area under curve** ).
