# Antibiotics

**Antibiotics**

Pharmacodynamics vary considerably: bacterial eradication is
time-dependent for Î²-lactams (ie dependent on the time spent above *MIC*
), concentration-dependent for aminoglycosides (ie more killing at
higher peak concentrations) and total drug exposure-dependent for
vancomycin, fluoroquinolones (ie dependent on the *AUC* above *MIC* ).
