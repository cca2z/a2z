# Blood substitutes

**Blood substitutes** have not yet made it to clinical practice. They
are of two types: perfluorocarbons (hydrocarbons with fluorine replacing
the hydrogens) and haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers. Both transport
oxygen, have short (12h) half-lives, and impair microvascular perfusion.

Perfluorocarbons are highly insoluble, so they are presented as a lipid
emulsion in egg phosphatide, just like propofol. Oxygen does not bind to
PFCs but they have an essentially unlimited capacity to dissolve gases,
so there is a linear relationship between oxygen content and PO2.
