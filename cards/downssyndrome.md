# Down's Syndrome

**Down's Syndrome** 1 in 700 live births. Trisomy 21 in 95% of cases, or
chromosomal translocation or mosaicism. On examination: low-set ears,
slanting eyes, epicanthic folds, single transverse palmar crease.
Anaesthetic problems:

*Airway:* Atlanto-axial subluxation in 10-20%.

Macroglossia, micrognathia, and short neck predict a nightmare airway,
but in practice failure to intubate is rare.

Tracheal stenosis in 5%. Post-operative airway problems in almost 40% in
one study. Check for a leak before extubating.

*Resp:* OSAHS in up to 75% of patients.

Chronic LRTI is common.

*Cardiac:* Congenital heart disease - particularly **ASD** , **VSD**
(with Eisenmenger's Syndrome), **Tetralogy of Fallot** . All should have
an echo.

*Neuro:* Cognitive impairment. Agitation post-op. Myopia and hearing
impairment common.

Hypotonia

*GI:* **GORD** is common.
