# Shunt equation

**Shunt equation** Calculates *effective shunt* . The calculated shunt
fraction treats **venous admixture** as if it were pure shunt. Shunt is
different because it is not correctable by high FIO2 (see **shunt** ).

It is derived using the same algebra as **deadspace** .

Note that shunt is affected by Hb concentration, since Hb largely
determines the content of oxygen in the fraction of blood that passes
alveoli. However the RCoA book suggests that the college do not believe
this.xxx
