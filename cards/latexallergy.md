# Latex allergy

**Latex allergy** has two presentations: Type 1 Hypersensitivity (2
<sup>nd</sup> most common cause of **anaphylaxis** under anaesthesia);
or type 4 hypersensitivity (T-cell mediated) causing contact dermatitis.
High risk in healthcare workers, mechanics, caterers, or if there is a
history of allergy to avocado, banana, chestnut or kiwi fruit. Up to 60%
of spina bifida patients are latex-sensitive, probably due to repeated
bladder catheterisation. Latex-free gloves, LMAs, ETTs, lines, and drug
ampoules should be used.
