# Amniotic fluid embolus

Caused by amniotic fluid entering uterine veins. Meconium-stained
amniotic fluid creates a worse reaction.

Massive inflammatory stimulus delivered directly to blood. Presentation
is usually with hypoxia, hypotension, or DIC. Progresses to diffuse
intravascular activation of innate immune response, causing organ
failure.
