# Haemoglobin (Hb)

**Haemoglobin (Hb)** (MW 64558Da) has four **haem** molecules, each of
which binds one molecule of oxygen.

Adult Hb (HbA) has 2α and 2β subunits;

foetal Hb (HbF) has 2α and 2γ;

Variant adult Hb (HbA <sub>2</sub> ) has 2α and 2δ.

When O2 binds to a subunit, Hb changes from the T ('tight') to the R
('relaxed') conformation, which increases O2 affinity ( *cooperative
binding* ), causing the characteristic shape of the **oxyhaemoglobin
dissociation curve** .

Functions: O2 transport, CO2 transport ( **Haldane effect** ),
buffering, and O2 demand-delivery coupling through release of NO in
hypoxic conditions.
