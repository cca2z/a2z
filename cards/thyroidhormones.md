# Thyroid hormones

**Thyroid hormones** are systhesised …xxx

Iodine → iodide (carbimazole inhibits)

Mono- and Di-iodothryronine synthesised from Tyrosine

Pair of MIT and DIT combined by thyroid peroxidase (propylthiouracil
inhibits)

T4 and T3 released. Peripheral conversion T4 to more active T3
(inhibited by propanolol).

Give iv T3 to treat thryroid crisis.

Amiodarone causes hypothyroidism initially by precipitating the
Wolff-Chaikoff effect, which causes decreased synthesis of thyroid
hormones in context of a large iodine load.
