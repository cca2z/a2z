# Inhalational anaesthetic agents

**Inhalational anaesthetic agents** are more potent if they have a
larger oil:gas solubility coefficient (the **Meyer-Overton observation**
) and have faster **uptake** and offset times if they are insoluble in
blood.

All are **ethers** , apart from halothane which is a *<span

class="underline">thane</span>*.

Desflurane, enflurane and to a lesser extent isoflurane produce carbon
monoxide in reaction with dry soda lime.
