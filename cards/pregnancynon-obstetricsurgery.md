# Pregnancy, non-obstetric surgery

**Pregnancy, non-obstetric surgery** Main problems are:

\- Teratogenicity (main concern in 1 <sup>st</sup> trimester)

\- Premature labour (main concern in 2 <sup>nd</sup> trimester), may be
precipitated by surgery but this is unusual with the exception of
cervical xxx

\- Foetal hypoxia (main concern in late pregnancy). Ion trapping of
opiates in the foetus is a concern immediately before birth.

(See **placenta** )
