# Brain

**Brain** usually weighs around 1.5kg, receives a blood flow of about
50mls/100g of tissue, and has a oxygen consumption (
**CMRO<sub>2</sub>** ) of about 38 mls/kg (ie. 10x whole-body average
**oxygen consumption**), amounting to 1/5 of total VO<sub>2</sub> . (See
also **circle of Willis** and **venous drainage of brain** ).
