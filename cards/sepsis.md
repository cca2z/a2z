# Sepsis

**Sepsis** is SIRS in the presence of known or presumed infection.

SIRS is the following:

CARS xxx

Severe sepsis is sepsis + at least one organ dysfunction:

Septic shock is severe sepsis + one of:

MAP &lt;60 (MAP &lt;80 if previously hypertensive) after resuscitation
(&gt;20ml/kg starch or &gt;40ml/kg saline or PCWP 12-20mmHg)

Dopamine &gt;5mcg/kg/min

Noradrenaline &lt;0.25 mcg/kg/min

Adrenaline &lt; 0.25mcg/kg.min

Aims of management:

Early (within 1h) effective *antibiotics* ;

Blood cultures before antibiotics;

Prompt imaging to find source;

Source control;

Early (within 6h) goal-directed resuscitation using fluid challenges to
restore filling pressure; measure lactate early, monitor CVP.

Vasopressors - noradrenaline or dopamine, MAP&gt;65mmHg

Inotropes - dobutamine

Refractory shock - stress-dose steroids

Target Hb 7-9g/dL unless hypoperfusion or ischaemic heart disease.

In ventilated patients:

Lung-protective ventilation - limit inspiratory plateau pressure; use
PEEP.

Elevate head of bed &gt;30Â°

Written weaning protocols

Sedation hold daily

Avoidance of neuromuscular blockers

Stress ulcer prophylaxis with H <sub>2</sub> -antagonist

Glycaemic control, target glucose &lt;150mg/dL

DVT prophylaxis
