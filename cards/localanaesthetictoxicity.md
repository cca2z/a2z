# Local anaesthetic toxicity

**Local anaesthetic toxicity** Early symptoms: tinnitus, circumoral
parasthesiae, light-headedness. CNS toxicity: convulsions, coma. Cardiac
toxicity: refractory ventricular dysrhythmia.

Management (see **emergencies** ):

Seizures: benzodiazepines/thiopentone/propofol.

Cardiac arrest: ALS algorithm. Give intralipid, consider
cardio-pulmonary bypass.

Intralipid dose for a 70kg patient would be:

\- 100ml bolus.

\- Start infusion 400ml over 20min.

\- Two more 100ml boluses at 5 and 10min.

\- 400ml over 10min.

After arrest, replace intralipid on arrest trolley, tell the NPSA, take
blood for measurement of local anaesthetic and lipid concentrations.
